It was late and the car was empty, save for the cutest, prettiest girl that floated next to me.

“You have to hear about my dream.”

She was eating cheerios, but the taste! Blueberry, then strawberry, then butterscotch!

She checked the box. Butterscotch-tasting cheerios means you win the Grand Prize, a trip to the Summer Olympics in London! Be sure to call within 15 hours! She called, and they answered, and everything was going great until the train beeped and she woke up.

“Isn’t that terrible?”

I turned, to empathize with her dream-loss, but saw that she was never there.
