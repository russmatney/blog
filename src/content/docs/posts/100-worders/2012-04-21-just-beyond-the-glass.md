An investor commissioned a secret project for a visionary young artist named Chambers. Chambers was given everything he demanded, construction and demolition crews, interior decorators, everything, right down to the last fork and knife.

They thought it would make the news on the first day, but it wasn’t until two months had gone by that a child on the C train asked his father if the subway could run through their apartment too. The boy was the investor’s son.

“No,” the investor replied. “The train only runs through Chambers’.”

No one else has noticed yet, but, believe me, it’s there.
