Frank kept his life to himself, scrutinizing every word.

He liked to wonder what people thought of him. Less information led to wilder ideas, so Frank always kept a tight lip.

Maybe his boss, holding the door, thought he was a secret poet or artist. Maybe his secretary thought he spent nights hacking the pentagon and holidays hunting black bears.

Maybe his wife thought he worked with the president, and had already told her too much.

In the end, Frank discovered that what most people thought of him was nothing, and what he thought of them was mostly made up.
