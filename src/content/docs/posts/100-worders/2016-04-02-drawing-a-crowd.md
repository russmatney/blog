NYC hat\
Thick rubber boots\
Drawing pad\
A few pencils\
Marker (noisy)\
No hair\
Lumpy face\
Old man\
Artist\
Drawing\
Subway sitter\
Looking across\
Stealing shapes\
Guessing, mathing\
Devil in the details

11:40 am friday, en route, F train, almost to Jay St

He finishes and hands it across to a woman\
Pulls out another\
Blank slate\
Let’s begin\
Hands dark and dirty\
Smiles up at me\
Think he’s drawing me now\
Keeps looking at me\
One can dream\
Fingernails dark and dirty\
Blue day today, beautiful\
Overcast and warm\
My nose drips and sort of tickles\
The shape comes out\
He’s molding me out of ink\
The car feels enraptured\
Or maybe it’s just me\
I wonder if i should ask permission to take a picture\
S’pose he didn’t ask lol\
Yoink (*Click*)

He’s the first thing you notice on the train\
He’s already noticed you

What kind of special is this feeling\
I can’t leave my spot\
I won’t flinch\
I wonder what and who and for how long
