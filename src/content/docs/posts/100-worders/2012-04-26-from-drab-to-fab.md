Why is the subway’s dominant clothing color a dull dark grey black blue? 

I’m not saying it’s a problem, it’s fine, wear what you want. I just wonder why we don’t break out more. 

Don’t say it’s because the people are underground, because most of them end up above the ground for most of the day. Or so I’ve heard. 

We should bring the sun down there and light that bad boy up. I’d wear Crayola 64-color Crispy Mac and Cheese pants to that commuter party. With a Pink Flamingo Strawberry Popsicle-flavored t-shirt. 

And I wouldn’t be the only one.
