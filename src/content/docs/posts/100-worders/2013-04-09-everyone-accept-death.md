This isn’t a real fear\
but sometimes\
I think I’m dying, a little bit

Not like drop-dead-in-the-street dying\
or even bed-ridden-hospital-battle-with-disease dying\
more like a slow walk, slowing to a crawl\
so gradual that no one even knows\
until everyone knows\
and one day you just don’t come into work\
and no one is surprised\
they just say, “yeah he should have run more\
or gone to the gym\
or joined crossfit\
I saw it happen to another guy, once.”\
and then they come get my body from my bed\
and I’m all shriveled and have old man fingers\
and then the roommate and the cat go through my stuff.\
“Who wants this stupid hat?” she says.

Anyway, that’s the fear.\
I say it’s not real\
because it all exists in my head\
and I won’t really accept death\
How can I accept death, really?\
Did I accept life?\
I feel like I haven’t had a choice either way

Of course, I’m all about making the best of it\
Life is a gift,\
and if you’re lucky enough to be sitting somewhere\
at a desk or on a bus or wherever\
then you should be pretty excited about this incredible opportunity.\
You really should.\
But that doesn’t mean we ever really accept death, does it?

Hypothetical:\
If I’m talking to someone on the phone\
and you ask me to hold your super heavy grocery bags\
and I’m not thinking, but my hand goes up because I’m making\
an important point\
and you put the bag over my wrist\
Have I accepted the bag of groceries?

Sometimes\
I think that’s what death is like\
you’re somewhere, distracted, probably on the phone\
or doing work, or traveling, or looking the wrong way\
and then someone puts a big heavy bag of groceries over your\
wrist\
it pulls you right down to the ground\
and you can’t really get it off.

I don’t know what else to say really, but here’s some advice\
Don’t let it drag you down\
But also, don’t leave the groceries out\
Put them away, carefully, until you’re all done.\
You’ll be sorry if the milk goes sour\
or the eggs begin to rot.
