# Straight Up OJ

There’s a moment.\
when you live alone,\
and it’s late,\
and you’re thirsty,\
and all the cups are clean cause you did all the dishes\
and you don’t feel like getting one out or making it dirty\
but you just bought some orange juice\
and orange juice is really for the morning\
but you want some anyway\
not a ton, just a little sip\
and you remember that you live alone, so\
you can do whatever you want\
and you open that oj up right then and there and take a sip straight from the bottle\
it fills you with not just oj\
but pride.\
sip it. savor it.\
let it last.\
you’re in a moment.\
sometimes it feels like it’ll last forever\
like it won’t go away\
like you’d rather have anything else\
but one day\
it’ll be different\
you’ll have a honey pickier than poo bear\
and a little squirt sippin bottles\
and you’ll be bringing home the bacon\
and you can still do whatever you want, you know\
but it just\
won’t be the same\
as this\
moment
