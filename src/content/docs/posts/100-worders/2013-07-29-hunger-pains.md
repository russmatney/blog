We are at the beach: blue sky, light wind, perfect temperature. We can’t miss a single moment. But we are hungry, and there is no food, so we eat Alyssa. It was a difficult but satisfactory solution.

Later, we are hungry again. Alyssa’s bones are clean, but she has a brother. Under the guise of burying him in the sand, we trap and eat him too.

The lifeguards have fled. Cops and cameras watch from the boardwalk. The quiet beach finally gives us room to breath. We are satisfied and smug, until we hear a rumble.

We are hungry again.
