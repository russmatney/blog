Dr. William “Spot” Johnson was to be the first labrador to pilot a spaceship to the moon. After finishing first in his major, Aeronautical Engineering, Spot had trained directly with NASA for years. He had anticipated this day since he was a pup.

In his specially designed cockpit, he began to flip switches and feel out the controls. The ship’s hull was loaded with essentials for a moon landing: delicious space-bones for food, equipment for scientific research, toys for alien space dogs.

Just then, Houston came over the intercom: “He looks so cute when he’s sleeping. Look at his tail!”
