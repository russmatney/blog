The kids said Dad was loosing his mind. "You mean losing." Mom said. The kids frowned. She wouldn’t understand. Maybe she’s loosing her mind, too. 

The tethers loosened more and more, and the minds floated higher and higher, like kites, or hot air balloons. 

The kids tried to tighten the knots, but they were too short or their fingers were too weak. 

A storm was rolling in. The balloons swayed in the wind. The littlest kid started to cry. 

“Maybe looser minds aren’t so bad,” said the oldest one. 

Great, thought the kids. Now we are loosing our minds, too.
