I used to know them.

They had dated on and off, and now they came to me in a dream, where you can never quite think properly.

There were tears in their eyes.

"We’re running away" they said, as if they were going to elope.

"Oh. Wow," I said. 

"We ran away," they said, as if from a car crash.

"Oh wow," I said.

"They ran away," they said, as if they were hit in the car crash.

"Oh, wow," I said. 

“Put that gun away,” they said, pointing to the gun.

“Oh.” I looked down at my hands. “Wow.”
