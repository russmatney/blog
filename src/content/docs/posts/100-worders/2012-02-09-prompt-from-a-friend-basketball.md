Everyday after school there was a shootout. Noah’s Arcs vs. Three’s Company. The chain nets rattled like spurs.

Each one got dirtier. Lowered the moral bar. No one remembers who threw the first rock. By now you’d get home with nicks and bruises.

Someone brought a cap gun. They got used to the BANG.

Then, there was the Secret Weapon, from some father’s hidden drawer. He held it in his pocket, pointed it at you while you shot.

The last shooter was used to the sound, but not the recoil.

The last shooter expected the BANG, but not the pain.
