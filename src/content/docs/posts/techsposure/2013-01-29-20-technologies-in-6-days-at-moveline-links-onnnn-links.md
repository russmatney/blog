Last week was my first week at <a title="Moveline" href="https://www.moveline.com/" target="_blank">Moveline</a>, a startup that is changing the way people move. Ramping up to the speed and technology of a cutting-edge business has been overwhelming and brain-blasting. Below is an attempt at a comprehensive list of the new vernacular.

The first big shift was not a language or a framework, but actually writing the code. I dove head-first into <a title="Vim" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a>, a text editor from 1991 that is still very efficient today. Vim saves you that precious time when you move your hands off the keyboard to the arrows or mouse, which might sound crazy, but once you rewire your brain, the little things add up. There are thousands of shortcuts, and after six days of mental heavy lifting, I'm starting to get a feel for them. For extra practice: <a title="Vim Adventures" href="http://vim-adventures.com/" target="_blank">Vim Adventures</a>, and <a title="Vim Golf" href="http://vimgolf.com/" target="_blank">Vim Golf</a>.

Vim is used in the <a title="Terminal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)" target="_blank">terminal</a> or on the <a title="command line" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank">command line</a>, so I'm starting to pick up those commands as well. These kinds of things (like all programming questions) are <a title="Google: terminal command shortcuts" href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=terminal+command+shortcuts&amp;oq=terminal+command+shortcuts&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0j0i7i30j0i30j0i5i30.244173.260747.0.261483.42.24.11.0.0.5.161.2358.11j12.23.0.les%3B..1.0...1c.1.n5-dURPx5dg&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.41524429,d.dmg&amp;fp=4a19662fa4882be9&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1144&amp;bih=683" target="_blank">google-able</a>.  I've also just learned about <a title="dot files" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-file" target="_blank">dot-files</a>, which can be used to set up custom settings. In my case, I wanted the best of vim configurations, and for now I've picked up most of my vimrc from <a title="Chris Garvis dotfiles" href="https://github.com/cgarvis/dotfiles" target="_blank">my new mentor</a>. I've also installed <a title="tmux" href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">tmux</a> (the terminal multiplexer), <a title="iterm" href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">iTerm</a> (a nicer Terminal), and <a title="ctrlp" href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim" target="_blank">Ctrlp</a> (fast fuzzy file searching).

Beyond writing the code, I'm adjusting to version control, aka <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>, and all the adding, committing, pushing, pulling, merging, and everything else that goes along with it. Practice makes perfect, right? And if you're looking for practice, check out <a title="shortcut foo" href="https://www.shortcutfoo.com/" target="_blank">ShortcutFoo</a>. It's got shortcut commands for Vim, <a title="sublime" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a>, Excel, Photoshop, Git, etc. By the way, if you're not willing to jump into the terminal or command line, Vim + Sublime is a great way to go.

Once that's set up, there's the development and testing environments, and all the testing. We run a VM using <a title="Vagrant" href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> and a suite of sweets for testing: <a title="Cake" href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/development/testing.html" target="_blank">Cake</a>, <a title="cucumber testing" href="http://cukes.info/" target="_blank">Cucumber</a>, and <a title="mocha" href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/" target="_blank">Mocha</a>, and I think there was a <a title="chef" href="https://github.com/opscode/chef" target="_blank">Chef</a> involved.

Now for the actual code base. I'm still getting a grasp of the apps we are running and how they're organized, so here's some gibberish: <a title="Node js" href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a title="backbone js" href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>, and <a title="mongodb" href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> (plus <a title="mongoose js" href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>). Then there's <a title="heroku" href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> and <a title="continuous integration" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a> kicking the dev cycle into over-drive.

Outside of all of this, there is the employee workflow. Constant communication is maintained through <a title="HipChat" href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank">HipChat</a> and <a title="Group Me" href="https://groupme.com/" target="_blank">GroupMe</a>, tasks and projects are maintained perfectly through <a title="sprintly" href="https://sprint.ly/" target="_blank">Sprint.ly</a> (which connects very nicely to Github), and calendars and other communication is as simple as <a title="gmail" href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=mail&amp;passive=true&amp;rm=false&amp;continue=https://mail.google.com/mail/&amp;ss=1&amp;scc=1&amp;ltmpl=default&amp;ltmplcache=2" target="_blank">gmail</a> (which didn't need a link, but while we're at it).

To wrap it up, I picked up some helper apps for my mac that were in the company culture: the <a title="Better snap tool" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12" target="_blank">BetterSnapTool</a> brings Windows window size options to the mac, and <a title="Flux" href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/" target="_blank">Flux</a> will modify your computer's display colors to match the sun. It's nice to see the sunset after a long day of programming. Time for for my <a title="coffee script" href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>.
