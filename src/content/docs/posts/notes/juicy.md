Juice (in Games)

--

A term that stands in for a variety of game-feel words. Pretty much means
some game's feedback mechanisms (shaders, screenshake, sounds, everything) are
chunky, crunchy, gnasty with a g, etc.

There's a talk somewhere with a break-out game and two devs ratcheting up the
juice to show how the impact....
# Effect examples
## brief action pause/freeze to emphasize bigger impact hits
street fighter punches
zelda big hits

called sleep in game maker
probably a sceneTree.pause in godot
## slow motion
## squash and stretch
## item delay - carried items lag behind
## gun recoil
super crate box
move player back when you shoot
## strafing
moving left/right while shooting doesn't change the direction you're facing

release shoot to turn
## bullets
### muzzle flash
first frame of bullet animation - just a circle
### impact
on enemy, on wall

every bullet hits SOMETHING
movie shoot outs in bars
## player trail
line or particles or dust or clones
## taking damage
### white flash
### knockback
## death
### death paint
something permanent and earned, changed by player actions
### permanence
leave the bodies
sense of previous combat
## screen shake
### wobble
### shock wave
### chromatic abberation
splitting the rgb channels
## props
dust/particles get pushed around
## camera
### lerp, smooth lag
### wobble
### emphasis on pois/danger/resources
### look ahead/behind when turning
## sounds!
### sounds rising up a scale for a combo
### footsteps
### doors
### punches
### explosions
### environment
### variety: pitch-bend
### blending multiple sounds
## particles
### running dust trails
### landing dust
### screen fog/particles
## eyes
### look at POIs
## text effects
### size (grow/shrink/repeat)
### wobble
hotline miami
### color
### borders
### particles
## experience, level up glow
# game examples
## Super Crate Box
## super meat boy
## hotline miami
## super time force
## super hexagon

quality: hand-held
content: great!

like making a baby!

game dev: beginning, like conception (sex!)
- later, you get fat, and it's a ton of work
- your friends lose respect for you
- then, birth - getting it out there, the hardest part, painful
  not fun
- then, not what you expected

creativity:
- experiment a lot
- dare to be serious
- renew your concept
- doesn't need to be fun
- create an atmosphere

idea: finding different endings!

easing functions on steroids

from comment: 'tunable normalized sigmoid function'
It can represent most of these shapes with just a change in a constant?

most important number ranges: [0, 1], [-1, 1]

perception of alpha is non-linear

easing functions
filter functions
lerping functions
tweening functions


ease-in - name is bad, it refers to 'fast at the end'
better name: smooth start

smoothstop (ease-out without sqrt)
flip - square - flip (1 - x, x^2, 1 - res)

library functions:
- smoothStart2345
- smoothStop2345

mixing/weighting/blending

smoothstart2.2 = mix(smoothstart2, smoothstart3, 0.2)
(80/20 weight)

weight as the time

smoothstep = mix(smoothStart, smoothStop, t) # t is time during easing

scale = t * f(t)
reverseScale = (1-t) * f(t)
arch = scale(flip(t)) = t * (1-t)
smoothStartArch3 = scale(arch2, t) = x^2 * (1-x)
smoothStopArch3 = reverseScale(arch2, t) = x * (1-x)^2

pretty awesome, excellent video, and not too long

worth implementing yourself

fun.

And, a nice creative box to trap yourself in.
