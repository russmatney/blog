Hi there, I'm Russ!

## Lately

### Log.gd v0.0.9 (August 2025)

#### Bring your own color theme!

A small Log.gd release on Friday broke the hard-coded colors out into
custom-resources. Now you can create your own `LogColorTheme`, or just point to
the included light or dark one in your project settings.

### Dot Hop 1.2 Release and Devlogs (Late July 2025)

I cranked on Dot Hop for most of July, ultimately releasing a 1.2 version at the
end of the month to all-the-places (Steam, Itch, Android, iOS, and soon Github
and Flathub).

Some relevant new posts:

* [Steam 1.0 -> 1.2 Release Notes](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2779710/view/539986853961400427)
* [Itch 1.0 -> 1.2 Release Notes](https://russmatney.itch.io/dot-hop/devlog/998752/dot-hop-12-now-available)

* [Dot Hop Speedrun/Spoilers/Stats Devlog](https://russmatney.com/#/devlogs/2025-06-10-dothop-speedrun)

More coming soon on the [Dot Hop docs site](https://russmatney.github.io/dothop/#/).

### Ported Poems/Rants from Medium (Early July 2025)

In the mid 2010s I wrote a bunch of poem-y things on Medium. They've since added
a paywall, which is very :eyeroll: so I've ported them into the 'Hundos' section
of the blog. Check 'em out!

### Godot Con in Boston (May 2025)

I just got back from Godot Con, and it was amazing!! So glad there was finally
one closer to me! So many indie devs and indie games to parse!

I wrote a Techsposure post covering most of my interactions here:
[Post: Boston Godot Con](/posts/techsposure/2025-05-09-boston-godot-con.md)

At Godot Con, I gave a lightning talk about
[Log.gd](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd). Updates, posts, and a YouTube
link to come soon!

### Dev Logs! (Jan 2025)

### New Hundos? Old Hundos? (Jan 2025)

I've resurrected a bunch of old content, including my [100 word
stories](/posts/100-worders/), which I like to call 'Hundos'.

Some 'new' "Hundos" (~2025)!
