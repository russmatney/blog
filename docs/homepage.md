Danger Russ Blog
====================

Hi there, I'm Russ!

I'm an indie game dev building games, mostly in Godot.

Welcome to the latest rendition of my blog!

## Lately

I've recently resurrected a bunch of old content, including my [100 word stories](/posts/100-worders/).

Check out my new [Dev Logs](/devlogs/) section for mostly visual updates on my projects.

* [DevLog: Glossolalia Listen Prototyping](/devlogs/2024-12-11-glossolalia-listen-prototyping.md) #glossolalia
* [DevLog: Zooming In On Dino](/devlogs/2024-01-08-zooming-in-on-dino.md)

You can also find all my older (and slowly, some newer) [Posts here](/posts/).

My most recent game is Carving With Care, which I built with the Cat Tale Games
team. Check it out [here on itch.io](https://cattalegames.itch.io/carving-with-care).
