Danger Russ Blog
====================

Hi there, I'm Russ!

I'm an indie game dev building games, mostly in Godot.

Welcome to the latest rendition of my blog!

## Lately

I've recently resurrected a bunch of old content, including my [100 word stories](/posts/100-worders/).
Check out [Posts](/posts/) for blog-posty things, and [Dev Logs](/devlogs/) for work-in-progress
updates on my projects.

My most recent game is Carving With Care, which I built with the Cat Tale Games
team. Check it out [here on itch.io](https://cattalegames.itch.io/carving-with-care).

I've released three steam games this year:

- Dot Hop is a grid-based puzzle game - it's simple but challenging!

- Dino is a mashup of last year's jam entries - right now it's procedurally
 generated platformer rooms.
