# About

Welcome to my blog! I've been through several implementations over the years -
this latest docsify version features writing from the last ten years, plus some
of my game dev content. Feel free to poke around.

## Tools

I make open-source 2D games using Godot, write code in Emacs, and I make
dev-tools using Clojure.

## Video

I started publishing video devlogs on youtube in 2024 - [subscribe here](https://youtube.com/@russmatney) to stay
tuned for more!

I sometimes stream while coding on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/russmatney), and I have a tiny [Discord](https://discord.gg/xZHWtGfAvF) if you wanna chat.

## Support and Socials

I post works-in-progress on [mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@russmatney), and once or twice a month updates on
[patreon](https://patreon.com/russmatney). You can also support me on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/russmatney).

I owe so much thanks to my patrons, who encourage me to keep going as I'm trying
to make this full-time open-source game dev dream work.
