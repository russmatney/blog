# Zooming In On Dino

Took some screen caps of poking around with org-roam-ui today.

Much thanks to Cameron for the inspiration!

Just way too many nodes.

One 'local tree' highlighted in purple (unreadable tho).

---

Rough 3D view.

We can see some clustering with the oranges - i think it just means those
nodes are given more gravity b/c they have more links.

Some nodes seem to have SUPER clusters of links - probably my indexes or
games-notebook, or my bigger projects.

maybe we want indexes to have more gravity, maybe not?

Disabled the dialies, and the galaxy can breath now.

I'd love to be able to read some of the text here...

Re-enabled orphans after disabling dailies - now we're cooking (showing in red).

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.42.11 PM.png" />

It's one thing for a node to be an orphan, another for it to be _only_ linked to
dailies (i.e. disconnected from the rest of the graph).

---

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.43.16 PM.png" />

Now just showing a hovered portion of the graph.

The text at this level of zoom is a joke to my old man eyes.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.44.03 PM.png" />

Same zoom level but with the massive DINO node hovered.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.44.06 PM.png" />

Maybe somewhere in here is whatever Dino wants to be?

---

### Later, zoomed much farther in on an edge.

The red orphans are the edge of the ocean before
the abyss, the more spacious (less dense) nodes along the edges.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.47.18 PM.png" />

What are these all about?

Is anyone else seeing topologies/shores?

---

### Later still

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.50.03 PM.png" />

#### Added some tag colors

Add some coloring-per-node - the white means 'published', which just means i
shipped an html version to my mess of a mind-garden at some point.

These could be setup for a review of some kind, but I've no idea what kind of
effort that'll be.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.52.15 PM.png" />

---

showing some of the core with highlighting and more tag colors.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.52.34 PM.png" />

Red now means tagged-'dino' or 'clawe', i think purple is just the fallback.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.52.41 PM.png" />

Cool, but damn if those labels aren't WAY TOO SMALL!

Async Mario Kart - one of my oldest tags for a bunch of concepts. maybe it'll
get made one day?

Me doing something with this idea is the equivalent of  a fifteen year old
saying: "I'm moving out and starting a band!"

## (And, Finally) Zooming-In on Dino

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.53.44 PM.png" />

In-context!

Emacs file open on the left, org-roam-ui open on the right.

(plz ignore clawebb error [and the main behind the curtain])

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.53.46 PM.png" />

Dino universe (note all the lines going off screen to far away nodes)

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.54.04 PM.png" />

Somewhat zoomed in.

<!-- <img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.55.01 PM.png" /> -->
<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 6.55.03 PM.png" />

Pretty much all the way.

Course, we can't see any of the content in these nodes, which is a real shame.

It'd be nice to know what-all is in them!

---

This tour was nice, but I'm wondering what I'm getting out of this tool.

Maybe time will tell, and I'll soon understand this hectic mind garden more conceptually?

What could/should i get out of this?\
Don't people think just fine without second brains?

---

Primarily i want the text to FILL the missing visualization space with
_something_... maybe giant smart-word-clouds?

Could this power my in-context cheatsheets?

could something similar to `org-roam-follow-mode` have it work in a workspace (repo) and
open-app(s) (scratchpads) context?

---

A couple final screen grabs of more meandering.

<img src="_images/mindgarden-screenshots/Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 7.47.36 PM.png" />

---

If you made it all the way through - thanks for zooming!

I like writing as a way to think, so i hope my ramblings are coherent.
They are largely unplanned and spur of the moment.

Maybe 'post-aging' is a good feature idea..

(goes back to hacking on something else)
