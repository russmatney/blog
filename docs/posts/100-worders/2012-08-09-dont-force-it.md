This hipster girl is wearing C-3PO shoes. Not look-alikes, the real thing. Bulky, but she can pull it, uh, him, off. 

The whole thing annoys me. He’s a chatterbox, C-3PO. Lots to say, nothing to say.

He has long conversations with the tourists, from the subway floor. Always brings the conversation back to himself. 

This hipster girl is ignoring him now, and he’s getting kind of mad. I wonder what he does in her closet, when she’s not wearing him. 

I say, “Your shoes."

She says, “Junk yard sale."

I say, “Well," pause for impact, “they make you look fat."
