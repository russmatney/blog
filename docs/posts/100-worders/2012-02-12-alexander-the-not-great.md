Alexander did not think about death. He could not comprehend the concept of time, and paid no mind to the sheer size of the universe. He only knew that he had an important presentation the next morning, and preferred a good night’s sleep.

So, when several Timeless Beings visited him that night, the gravity of the meeting escaped him.

He blinked slowly while they laid a plan for Alexander, giving deep, profound meaning to his existence. He nodded as he lay back down.

Speechless, the Timeless stared. Alexander rolled over and mumbled, “Just be sure it’s all finished by morning.”
