title: Eventually, it's a game.
---

You're writing a story, a novel, a comic.
In the end, you can't justify it unless it's a game.
Which has the effect of un-justifying it.

Which you think is kinda like un-indenting?

You start in medias res at the funeral,
talk them through a moment with Otto the bartender,
meditate on the backstory while fire-escaping.

They're ninja running through the surveilled streets.
Hacking through locked doors. Ducking cameras.
Dodging the senator's goomba drones.

When you come at last the first taste of action, it hits.

"g.d. it, this needs to be a Beat Em Up."
