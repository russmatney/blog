I have a challenge for you: imagine you’re eating a big bowl of rice, and suddenly you find a giant piece, about as big as a big toe! What do you do? Do you call the museum, or the police?

Now imagine you’re eating a big bowl of tonsils, and suddenly you realize they’re full of tonsil stones! What do you do?

Finally, let’s imagine you’re back at that big bowl of rice, eating and eating, when suddenly you find the big piece of rice! But this time, it’s not a big piece of rice.

It’s a big tonsil stone!
