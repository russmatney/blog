# my lil rubber wedding ring

dropped the ring at a bar called ontario\
could NOT find it and was pretty sad\
kept digging through my bag like a maniac

not sure anyone noticed\
yet\
everyone did?

i eventually spotted it\
around the tree stump table\
'tween two rubber boots of a nerd

snatched it nonchalantly\
which is to say\
yawnstretcharmout\
leanswipesnatch\
zomgmyprecious\
illneverletyougo

my lady love, my babe, my one and only got me this\
impossible to return home without it\
come hell or high water

tho if it's all the same to you\
please hold that high water\
just hell for me thanksverymuch.
