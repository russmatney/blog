Darkness only comes out at night, and, sadly, less and less these days. It barely has time to breathe anymore.

When the lights go out and the screens flick off, there is so much to see. Let your imagination open its eyes. Let the stories come to life.

Beings wait, just out of sight, behind the nearest tree, under your bed.

Emotions that run from the light grip your mind and shake you awake.

Let it envelope you, or comfort you. Let your dreams skip about, or let them run amok. A nightmare is only a dark horse. Ride it.
