It starts with a nod\
and ends with a screamed "STOP APOLOGIZING!"

i was in a deep mental pit\
there was nowhere left to scroll\
so I went to the store

the promise of spiked seltzer and "self-medicating"\
my body is a lab rat, my mind steers

> GET ON WITH IT!

Sorry!\
On the narrow bit of sidewalk outside Mr. Market.\
Or is it Ms. Market? Mrs. Market?

> GET ON WITH IT!!

Ahead of me, walking toward me, a person switches lanes\
from the middle - away from me - toward the sidewalk\
taking the outside lane near the curb, going around the lamppost

I'll draw you a diagram la-

> GET ON WITH IT!!!!

Yeah alright sorry!

i nodded and mumbled a thank you,\
then moved to pass the lady in front of me

suddenly\
quickly\
the person

stepped back in my lane\
direct eye contact\
aggressive:

> "What are you saying to me?"

I was caught off guard and crushed.\
I was crumbling and mumbling.\
"I was just saying 'thank you'"

> "What? You're confusing me! Are you saying something to me!?"

I couldn't match them.

I was babbling while my brain reeled\
`walkinglanes` - `noddingtostrangers` - `howdyneighbor`\
I was `sayingsorry` - `itwasnothing` - `justathankyou`.

    I've thought alot since
    about this person's personal rain cloud.

in the moment i think projected my full doom-scroll onto them.\
And I was sorry that they felt how i felt. (did they?)

this person couldn't know i've run 2k+ miles in the park\
thinking all-that-time about walking lanes\
wearing my `holdon.letmeoverthinkthis` tee\
being `weirdlysouthernwaytoofriendlyhowdythere` to randos

And how much my mood that day just needed a little `you're-welcome`

This person had `RAGE`. they were mad! They were angry!\
Maybe at me!\
if they weren't mad at me before,\
my sorries were certainly getting us there.

> "What are you saying?! I'm confused! Stop Apologizing!"

Clear voice, great presence, this one ^.\
Should consider the debate team.

I'd been scrolling and cloistering, and for days.\
mulling over mind-boggling executive orders and recind-sions\
the patent and blatant denial of people's basic humanity\
feeling local and global paranoia about the _actual intentions_ of people\
content to act in such _obviously evil_ ways\
denying whether humans exist at all\
or if they deserve any shred of decency or compassion

i can't understand how so many people are so asleep at the wheel\
while the maniac millionaire bus drivers steer us straight off the cliff

and here _I_ am, asleep on my feet, caught in a cloud\
right on the sidewalk.\
I can't even talk to people. I just confuse them.

    I'm trapped in my head!

I collapsed under the sidewalk RAGER'S questions.\
I started to just walk away\
praying to `Yoda` and `Miyazaki` that they would let me go.\
As we (finally) departed,\
i picked myself up to say one more thing.

> "Look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to make a whole thi-"

They flipped out. Full scream this time.

!> "STOP APOLOGIZING!!!"

That final yell really shook me.\
It felt like it shook the whole (`thankgoditsempty`) block!\
I can still hear it in my mind's ear. (mind's ear*s*?)

In the store i caught myself as tears hit me\
which made it worse b/c it was mixed with embarrassment!\
like `wtf is happening i'm just walking to the store!`\

    i was shook.

Take deep breaths and just hold on.\
Everything is fine.\
There's a storm coming, but it's not here yet.

i bought eggs.\
I never buy eggs, but it was in the doom-scrolls so it seemed\
important.

i realized i have no idea how much we normally pay for eggs.\
I'm one of of these g.d. sleeping bus driving egg heads!\
I'm asleep at the wheel!

I feel bad about this, but before I can say I'm s-

> STOP! APOLOGIZING!

I made it back home\
watched Green Planet and Princess Mononoke\
(focused recovery couch time)

I've been processing this for days\
and writing this out has helped a ton\
Thank you Flash Fiction February and RAGE PROMPT\
OK I LOVE YOU GOOD NIGHT SEE YOU TOMORROW
