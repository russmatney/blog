Later, as if he’d planned it, He fell from the sky into the lake, just three feet from the front of my canoe. I had been fly fishing for two hours, praying to the Dear Lord from some sort of deliverance, just like my poppa taught me. Now, here He was, soaking wet, covered in algae, almost capsizing the boat as He clambered in, beard and robe quite askew.

"Deliverance?" He said, the way my pizza guy says "Delivery?" 

"I was hoping for some fish."

"Oh. Cast your net over the other side." Then he walked right off the lake.
