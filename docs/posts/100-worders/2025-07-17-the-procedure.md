# the procedure

overheard folks talking about a cat\
wasn't sure for a minute\
maybe a metaphor?\
"she calls you to bed?"\
"you scratch.... behind her ears... and her tail"

a 4th showed up and 2 left\
not the two you'd think

they give john malkovich / get out vibes\
older / younger couple meet / greet\
our pets, our habits, what not

should we undergo THE PROCEDURE?\
our little brain swapperoo?\
you will love it, i swear\
we'll join you in your bod, your head\
together we'll share our riches\
a close friend... for life

eh, i'd prolly do it
