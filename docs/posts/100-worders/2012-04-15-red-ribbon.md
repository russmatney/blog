I see you there, the red ribbon in your hair. What is this, the girl scouts? A secret club? Or are you really that interestingly dressed for work?

Does it distract you at your desk, while you twirl it? Do your coworkers look when they walk by? Did you wear it while you talked to your boss about that promotion today?

Were you looking for a date? Or compliments from your favorite bum?

I’ve got some good ones I’ve been saving for you. But you know what? You get no hoots this time. This bum thinks you’re trying too hard.
