# to feel like new

this year feels shorter than last

life stretches `forever` forward\
your mind falls `forever` back

pan all the way back out.\
think: _keep it together, hold it in_ \
fear: _not one detail can be lost!_

you've tried everything to find it, to feel it\
a thousand schemes and sacrifices

panned out, `details` are escaping!\
what's happening in your moment?\
are you blasting that same album?\
bundling up a buncha nostalgia brownies?

Renewal is here.\
Your `Great Rebirth`.

Pick your poison, your methodology, your broken-promise

What's the `symptom`, what's the `disease`?

You can take that extra life and stuff it.
