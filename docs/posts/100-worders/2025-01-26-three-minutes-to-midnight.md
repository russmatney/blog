# Three minutes to midnight

You're home alone and nothing to do\
you look up to the sky and realize\
you're in a small room\
nothing to see\
the windows only show you the building next door\
i bet they can see things?\
probably.

"How many words is that?"\
Ugh that early question.\
implies so much fear, and yuck.\
the story has no legs, no where to go.

and to think!\
you used to write without worry!\
now look at you.\
up late trying to crank out some bs before midnight.

well, it's alright. take a deep breath.\
i always say:

if it's 9:28\
and you can't get just one thing done\
how are you ever going to do ANYTHING EVER

break it up - do the first 20 minutes of whatever you're going to do tomorrow\
even if it means a little doodle in your journal

How many words is that?

147 wtf?! time to cut it up
