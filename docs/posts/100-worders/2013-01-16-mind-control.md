Story idea: guy who can make people go away, just by writing about them.

Later, he learns the trick, and can do it by talking at or about them.

Still later, all he has to do is think, and they’ll drift onwards, elsewhere.

It’s a good story, and there are problems and conflicts. He has trouble controlling his thoughts. He thinks about whatever’s in sight, and soon, everyone he sees is a surprise person that he has never thought of before.

Not long after, they too are driven away.

I suppose he just dies alone. Or stops thinking so much.
