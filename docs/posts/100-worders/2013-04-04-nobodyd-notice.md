# Nobody'd Notice

Nobody’d notice\
But I wear colorful stripey socks\
Under my shoes and long pants

Nobody’d notice\
That I listen to headphones\
Even though I can’t hear a thing

Nobody’d notice\
But these drawings are supposed to be scary,\
NOT funny, even though you all laugh at them

Nobody’d.\
Nobody’d notice.

Nobody’d notice\
That these dark circles under my eyes\
Light up like the sun when it’s time to sleep

Nobody’d notice\
Everything they might notice\
That anybody would notice\
If I let anyone notice.

Chumps.
