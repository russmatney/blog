# I'll Tell You!

My buddy greg told me this story about his niece\
she can’t really talk but she has one phrase down\
she can say “I’ll tell you!”\
and that’s it

What is she going to tell us?\
I’m sure she knows something\
It has to be important\
The untapped mind, such potential

she’s probably the smartest person in the world right now\
i’m here talking too much and trying to find words for people\
i’m wanting to get everyone up off their butts with some itty bitty letters\
how could that do anything, they don’t even physically exist\
they’re not even ink on a page anymore\
this is just pixels, it’s just data

i walked by staples today and there was a group of people telling me not to\
buy staples\
i don’t need staples\
and paper is old anyway\
they had some words for me\
but staples are just dangerous anyway, i stay away\
i remember a story from when i was a kid\
my sister had accidentally stapled her finger\
isn’t that terrifying? i was afraid, even now\
i’m still scared!\
NO I WON’T BUY STAPLES I PROMISE\
AND I WON’T ABIDE BY OTHERS PUTTING THEMSELVES IN SUCH A BAD WAY\
ok i’m tired, have to keep going for food now\
sorry angry mob, i’ll join you guys next time\
for now i gotta eat

I had a dream last night that was, again, way too involved\
I was dating somebody, who it was is apparently not important\
but her mom was basically an ex-girlfriend’s mom\
who was super nice, all the time, i really liked her\
but in this dream she was asking us-all to go see a movie\
and by us-all, i mean the two of us and the other 40 people who we were suddenly with, despite it being 3 AM and rural Virginia\
and so we all went of course because the dream had no other future\
Anyway, these details don’t matter\
what matters is that we went to the theatre but we were starving\
but luckily someone had prepared taco fixins for everyone\
and i wasn’t too far back in line but HOLY MOLEY IT WOULDN’T MOVE\
and we had to eat, stat, lest we fall into despair and starvation like the first humans, forever wandering and eating weeds and hoping they aren’t poison\
I walked around the table many times but couldn’t get at it without breaking complicated social norms\
so I eventually died and woke up starving

Never sleep through breakfast.

There’s a stronger bit i wanted to get back to here\
where greg’s niece Tells Us-All.\
The point she’s making is that life isn’t meant to be told\
it’s meant to be lived\
she’s telling us that there’s nothing to tell, that we should wake up and live and stop listening for a reason, for an answer\
the answer is within us\
we already have it\
if you look inside, you know you don’t need to be told\
you’re all ready to go\
just, get going already!

I’LL TELL YOU!\

*sleeps like a baby*
