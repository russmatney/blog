# Would it bother you if i didn't leave you alone?

    Fall in love, fall in love
    Be happy, be happy
    (bees, melted, ty segall. at least that’s what it sounds like.)

Sometimes i wonder why i always fall in love in the Fall\
is it the cold or the change or the beauty\
everything looks good and warm and nice\
just when you start to feel cold and alone and hybernate-y\
you lose the sunlight and find it in other people

that sounded pretty much right, until a few moments ago when i realized\
it’s\
much\
simpler\
than that.\
you fall in love in Fall because it’s part of the Fall.\
Fall.\
In.\
Love.\
You can’t be in the Fall without being in the Love.

For those of you that this was immediately-way-too-sappy-for -\
whoever thought: UGH I CAN’T STAND THIS! -\
why are you still reading? you don’t have to torture yourself!\
As a punishment i’m going to tell you about a meaningless dream i had the other night\
in which i freed a trapped turtle from a small box and we entered a talent show\
i’ve since named him Neutrino, the fastest and least understood turtle in the universe\
and i plan to torment him endlessly with a rigorous training regimen\
he’ll be a teenage mutant ginger turtle and i’ll be his track coach\
and i’ll taunt him mercilessly as i effortlessly crush him in all our races to the kitchen.\
There, now you have that on your conscience too.

Next time you won’t click the link bait.
