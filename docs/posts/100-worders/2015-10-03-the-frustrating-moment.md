# The Frustrating Moment

The frustrating moment\
is having things-to-say hide\
just out of reach\
behind this big gray amorphous blob that i call DOUBT\
and feeling-full-of-shit\
and apologizing-constantly\
even though your brain is BURSTING with HARD TRUTHS\
that the world Begs to hear\
and to see\
and to touch and taste and squeeze

You’re almost there\
you’ve done the work\
the thoughts are alive, and that’s farther than most explorers ever get\
but suddenly you grab a pen and your mind fills up with\
wars and conspiracies and market crashes\
and jen and death and taxes and peanuts\
and unions and code and life and work\
and you’ll just never make it back to anything that’s worth anything\
while you’re stuck with the task of deciphering all this meaningless nonsense\
and most of the people with the superpowers have sold their souls into advertising and enslavement\
and the rest have chosen to obsess with computers because they’re the only thing that listens

so who’s up to working with the world as it is?\
i know i’m not, i’m stuck here whining about it

i wish i had a filter for all this\
because the litterbox is starting to stink

all you are is ears and edits\
and years and a brain\
and sobriety on a good day\
and by time you get back there\
what the fuck is ever left
