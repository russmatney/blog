On the facing platform, a performance is taking place. It is Canal St.

Originally written by Homer, then reimagined by Bill Shakespeare, the play features a bucket-drumming beggar, his friend without a home, and the unlikely tale of their friendship at the hands of several young, apparently deaf, scornful women.

Critics rave! 4-star reviews!

"Best kept secret on Broadway."

"Canal St. is honest and pure, the perfect execution of a forgotten classic."

“Well, it was ok.”

"Who ever played [the homeless guy] really stares truth in the face. I was so blown away that I almost missed my train. Almost."
