# Great Owl Circle

1.\
I had an uncle who was always so fun\
And I learned later it was because he was bad\
Or, maybe just wild. Maybe.\
Anyway, the most fun\
Was when he tossed my dad’s exercise ball\
And we were on the swings\
And I punted it up onto the deck during dinner

2.\
There are mountains and tall buildings\
And huge whales and all that\
But the biggest, most impassable thing I know of\
Is on Great Owl Circle in Virginia.\
NO ONE has EVER ridden a bike to the top of that hill.\
And no one ever will.

3.\
There is a brick wall with a hole in it\
For some reason it’s important.\
My sister told me she did her math homework in there,\
But I think that only happened once.

What I remember is not far from there,\
a tree that I could actually climb\
Or at least the first branch.\
My best friend and I played Star Wars,\
I was the Emperor and he was Darth Vader

(everyone knows the Emperor was in charge,\
but in case you didn’t, he totally was)

Darth Vader went rogue. Just like in the movie.

4.\
There is a stretch of sidewalk\
Where I learned how to ride a bike\
Next to a small hill\
Where we used to sled in the snow\
But really what I remember about that little hill\
Is how long it took to climb up in the snow\
That sled had to weigh 200 pounds

5.\
The kid across the street was Christopher\
Christopher something\
I want to say Christopher Robin\
But I feel like that’s from something else\
Anyway\
He was from the hundred acre woods and had a stuffed pooh bear and little pig and bounced around a lot singing yippee and would sometimes grow carrots and other times just mope like a donkey.

6.\
One time.\
It was Spring.\
And the weather was beautiful.\
And it was a school day.\
And it was probably 7 am.\
And my dad burst into the room and said\
IT SNOWED! SCHOOL’S CANCELED!\
It must have been April Fool’s.\
I ran to the window and saw all the green green grass\
And the floor fell out from under me\
And I was inconsolable.

7.\
There were many things that happened at our old house\
But one that we talked about recently\
Was the time a friend came over and just about tore down our tree after a ball got stuck in it\
My dad was furious. We were trying to sell the house at that point.\
So he took us to the park.

We called that park Park-in-a-park\
And when we were little\
We’d get ready for school as fast as we could\
So we could go for just a few minutes\
And we’d sit on the swings\
And dad would sit behind the clear plastic bubble thing\
And pretend he was a tv show\
He is probably the best man ever in the world.
