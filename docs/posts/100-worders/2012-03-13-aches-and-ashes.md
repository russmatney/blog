I had this friend who totally fell apart. Aches started in his joints, and his face was burning up. 

Later he was losing things. He dropped his fork and never found it. He thought it was gremlins, or the cat. 

Chunks started to fall off. Hair, skin from his chest, his left foot. 

Yesterday he missed work, so I went to see him. Ashes covered his bed and a newborn lay there, cooing. Cutest thing I ever saw.

I don’t know much about raising a kid. I bought a kennel and a food bowl, so I think I’ll be alright.
