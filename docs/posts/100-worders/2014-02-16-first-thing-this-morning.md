# First Thing This Morning

She says:\
we were driving\
and you pulled over to turn around\
and it was muddy\
and another car, a BMW, swerved and flipped over\
and it’s driver, a Beagle, flew out into the mud\
and he was sinking into the mud and had hurt his back\
and he was so angry and scared and said “Why did you do that?”\
we scooped him up and had him on the floorboards and were driving him\
and his phone rang\
and he answered it\
and I could only hear his side of the conversation\
and he sounded so scared\
“Yeah, it’s me. I got hit. No. Yeah. They’re taking me to Woodbridge animal hospital. I… I think so. I don’t know. My face.”\
but then I woke up, and I don’t know what happened to him

Isn’t that the worst dream you ever heard?
