# Who's in charge here?

My boss: not the brightest bulb.

"Dr Evil Omen"\
The dark mask, the hood and cape.\
Pointing at you from the propoganda posters.

> He's a dingus.

When we met, he was a joke.\
He was trying and failing to steal people's coffee orders.

"I'm Kimberley," in his deep robotic monotone, trying to snag a vanilla latte.\
The barista says "No." Not without a smirk.

Truth is, I was embarrassed for him.\
I never expected him to win me over.

> Did he?

I bought him a coffee.

I have needs.\
I need to be second-in-command.\
I need to hatch wicked schemes and whisper them around the hideout.\
Two drinks in (some liquid courage), I'll convince you: this one is _flawless_.\
We're going to rule the world! (more needs)

Probably I'm a coward.\
A not-so-humble serial side-kick.\
To the dumbest of villains.

The dumber the better, mostly - let's prop up this shmo!\
We lift the leader onto the chopping block.\
Let him meet the consequences, head-first!

> In my leader, I need...
> - end-of-the-world legs (No small-timers)
> - someone who values loyalty **highly** (so we can hire more idiots)
> - someone who will take all the credit (I'll et-tu-brutus them later)

To wrap this up, let's just say: watch out for the villains out there.\
They're probably dumber than you are.
