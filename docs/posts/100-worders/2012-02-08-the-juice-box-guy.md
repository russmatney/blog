On the news they said he was poisoning juice boxes, one at a time, with a syringe, at a gas station. I brought a girl home but she said my bathroom smelled like piss and my room like farts. So I went after him.

Fourth gas station, I realized this was a bad plan. Fifth, I found him.

In a Shell, lab coat and everything, syringe in one hand, juice box in the other.

“So you’re the juice box guy.”

He stuck himself and injected, left forearm.

Waiting to die, he stabbed with the bendy straw and sipped. Fruit punch.
