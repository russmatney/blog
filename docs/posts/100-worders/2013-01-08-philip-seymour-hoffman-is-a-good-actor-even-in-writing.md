I was riding the train and thinking too much, when I realized the man sitting next to me was Phillip Seymour Hoffman, old as death, like at the end of Synecdoche, holding a manuscript, and crying a little.

I eyed him in the reflections and stared out the corner of my eye. He heaved silent sobs.

"Philip?" I asked. “Jaden?" (His name in Synecdoche).

He looked at me, almost spoke, frowned, and shook his head. 

The next stop was mine, and I got off, but I feel like I should have stayed with him, just a stop or two longer.
