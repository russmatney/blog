# How To Fall Asleep: A Lullaby

Sleeping sweetly, you are so so sleepy\
The world is in peace around you\
Just relax, just for a minute\
Let it all escape your mind

WARS and DEATH and SEX and TAXES\
Should not bother you\
Anxious children, Starving children\
Just Ignore those children too

Forget your boss and all the work that\
Yesterday you were s'posed to do\
It doesn't matter, work is meaningless, and\
Tomorrow, it will still be there, for you

Remember that nightmare from your childhood?\
Oh now look what you've done\
Let it go, too\
You'll never sleep, you\
Unless you can forget that, too

One thing that helps me sleep\
Is a little game I call "If only..."\
You just start sentences like that\
Until morning

If only I hadn't done That Thing\
I'd pro-ba-bly have Learned To Sing\
Then Her Heart would have been Mine\
And she'd be here All Of The Time

Never-mind if that's not what I wanted\
My mind is only happy haunted\
If only I could learn to think\
I think I'd learn to stop.
