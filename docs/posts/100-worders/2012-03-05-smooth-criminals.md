The Warden of the 18th State Penitentiary announced a dance competition. He wanted to scout backup dancers for his daughter’s performance in the school talent show. 

Every prisoner auditioned, but three stood out: Big Bob, Lanky Larry, and Tiny Tim with his crutch. Each put his heart and soul into the final song, which was Thriller, and even some of the hardened prisoners had to dry their eyes after witnessing such beauty. The Warden had no choice but to name all three as winners.

In the end, it didn’t matter. The Warden’s daughter changed her mind, and did gymnastics instead.
