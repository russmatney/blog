I walked onto the platform to find five ghouls eating McDonald’s and tossing the trash across the tracks. They all stared across the gap, not noticing as I stepped between them. 

On the facing platform two rats fought over the unwanted half of a cheeseburger. The ghouls were captivated by the fight, unable to look away. Finally the smaller rat fell off the track, and the larger devoured the burger.

I always pull for the underdog, so I felt bad. Since this is my story, I’ll leave you with the larger rat’s unwitting demise at the hands of his cholesterol.
