# Sometimes

Sometimes you’re writing\
and there’s a bright light in your eyes so you can’t really see\
so you go to adjust the lamp\
and the whole thing just comes apart in your hand and the white light\
blinds you\
and you realize this thing has been broken for years\
and before that it wasn’t even yours\
you just wandered into a new york apartment at one point\
and it was just waiting for you\
sockets working: one of three\
pretty good odds for light, really\
1 in 3 is a hell of a lot better than 0 for 3\
though low light can be amazing if people are willing to sit in it\
take a minute and let it all sink in

it’s kind of cool what things want to glow\
which things you can make sense of\
how many levels of shadow there really are down at the bottom\
sure you can’t much see the face\
but the eyes, the nose, the lips, the tongue\
your eyes can catch\
the hair catches a glimpse\
you can see the pieces meld into the air, the universe merge together

light is nice sometimes.\
definitely sometimes that you need it.\
open heart surgery, for example. I wouldn’t do that in the dark.\
or eating a big hulking fish that hasn’t been gutted yet.\
but most things become more interesting.\
you ever try to draw in the dark? i always like it, i feel like i can see and make exactly what i want.\
of course it looks like garbage under the fluorescents.\
but so does skin, so do teeth.\
light’s a nice idea.\
don’t forget about the dark.
