It was somewhere between the broken ankle, the painkillers, the cast, and the spaceship, that our intrepid hero found herself on the moon. And there were dinosaurs. Wearing moonboots.

The show was this Tuesday, and all the dinosaurs were abuzz. Everyone expected T-Rex to win with his rainbow-striped boots, but some of the pterodactyls and triceratops were putting up a fight, with the clever use of pink and orange solids.

In the end, our intrepid hero stole the show. Her boot and crutches were like nothing they’d ever seen. She stole the crown and crowd surfed on dinosaurs all night.
