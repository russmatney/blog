recent daily posts have me remembering the hundo flow

get some words out, then get out some more\
count 'em and don't think twice, JUST HIT POST\
internal monologue dEbAtINg\
an emotional spike says THIS IS GARBAGE ya-shud-hide-yaself

but fear not!\
my gemini brain constantly reverse-engineers a fresh new devil's advocate with a
counter argument\
each louder than the last

I stomp the spike and i've already hit submit

...and now comes the shame.\
welp, only way out is to write another one! LEZZZ GOO!

zzzz (<- me sleeping)

Feels like it's been a decade, and sure enough it freaking has.
