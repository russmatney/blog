He was a man of illogical emotions.

            She could not stand extreme temperatures.

He hated bubbles, especially those that sprung from shampoo.

            She hated that turning down the cold sometimes made it colder.

He loathed the shower curtain, rising to meet you, like a ghost.

            She loathed physical contact with water above or below 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Still, they showered together, scowling in their anger.

Because you had to shower, you know, or you would stink.

She popped the pesky bubbles. He blocked the boiling or freezing water.

And they were happy to fight the shower, and not each other.
