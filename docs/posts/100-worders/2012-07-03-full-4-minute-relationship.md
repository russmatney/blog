Crush: I stand next to her on the platform because she’s cute, and because she smiled at me.

Honeymoon: I am happy to have found such a person, and catch her stealing glances while checking for the train.

Love: My misty eyes know there is nothing like what we have. We could make this work.

Heartbreak: The arriving train is hers and not mine. I say nothing. She boards, turns, and stares. We don’t break eye contact for as long as we can, until the train is one stop ahead.

Sometimes you don’t work up the nerve until it’s over.
