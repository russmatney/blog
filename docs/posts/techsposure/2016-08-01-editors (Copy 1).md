TLDR: sublime text is the old standard - if you want the new hotness, it's Atom or Brackets. If you want to be productive long term (duh) learn vim and put the time into iterm +tmux and/or emacs.

writing code is not a light commitment; your editor is a serious choice too. For your own sake, Try more than one.

Dreamweaver - heh.
Sublime Text.
Atom.
Brackets?
Vim bindings please.
