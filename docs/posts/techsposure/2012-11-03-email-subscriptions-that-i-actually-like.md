I hate getting spam, and I love Unsubscribing from email chains. In fact, I do it on an immediate, get-this-out-of-my-inbox-I-never-want-to-see-you-again basis. But there are some that make me just glow, and I thought I'd share the happier side of email with you guys. These are my favorites.

<strong>Webdesigner Depot's monthly newsletter. </strong>The consistency of the great content in WD's newsletter actually inspired this blog post. I recommend signing up as well as checking out the past issues. You can do both <a title="Webdesigner Depot Newsletter" href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/newsletter/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<strong>10 Things You Need to Know This Morning.</strong> I found this through this <a title="IFTTT 10 Things" href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/12567" target="_blank">IFTTT Recipe</a>, but really it comes from <a title="Business Insider 10 things" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-you-need-to-know-this-morning-2-2012-11" target="_blank">Business Insider</a> every weekday. It's a wonderful daily tech-business review, and the IFTTT Recipe delivers the ten lines as text rather than images, which makes it a quick load and an informative, 30-second read (or more if you want to follow any of the links).

<strong>Udemy's Course of the week. </strong><a title="Udemy" href="http://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> is a great place to take online courses that will teach you how to be whatever you want to be. I use it primarily for programming languages and the adobe creative suite, but it's a great place to find quality tutorials for anything, at any learning level. The course of the week announced via email is discounted and usually enticing.

<strong>Smashing Newsletters.</strong> Bimonthly, and covering all that Smashing Magazine covers (Coding, Design, Mobile, Graphics, UX, Wordpress), <a title="Smashing Magazine Newsletters" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/smashing-newsletters/" target="_blank">these newsletters</a> are great places to review the latest in web trends.

Of course, if you don't like email or can't wait for the next one, <a title="Design Feeder" href="http://www.designfeeder.com/" target="_blank">DesignFeeder.com</a> aggregates RSS feeds from a variety of tech and web design sources.
