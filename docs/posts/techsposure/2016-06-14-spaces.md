###*TL;DR*:

Spaces are a built in mechanism for keeping your application windows in separate buckets.

For example, one space could hold your social messaging apps/tabs while another holds your work-related apps.

Control over them stems from `Mission Control`, and is configured via `System Preferences > Mission Control`.

##Get a handle on them

Crucial to taking advantage of spaces is getting a handle on [Gestures](/techsposure/gestures/),
and then the available features in `Mission Control`.

###Build-a-space:

1. Three-finger swipe up to open Mission Control
2. Click and hold on an Application (A Chrome window, for example)
3. Drag to:
  - An already-open Space
  - To the upper right-hand corner to create a new one
  - To the right of an existing space, to create a full-screen App

###Navigating the Infinite Frontier;

- **Mission Control** and clicks for days
- 3 and 4 Finger swipes to slide back and forth between them

###`Handy` features

To Delete a space:

1. Open Mission Control
1. Move mouse up to spaces
1. Wait for the little `X` to appear in the upper left of a space
1. Click it or ticket.

##Who needs a Dashboard?

The Dashboard might be useful to some people... 

If you want to disable it as a space, play with the `Dashboard` setting in `System
Preferences > Mission Control`.
