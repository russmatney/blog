# Fave Godot Addons

A hopefully well maintained shortlist of Godot Addons that I love to "add on".

> Apologies for that lame pun.

Not too much yet - this file will grow! I have tons to add and comment on - the
community is growing rapidly!

These are grouped into two big chunks: Not-mine, then mine. Within that, it's
just alphabetical.

TOC:

- Not Mine
  - [GDUnit](#GDUnit)
  - [MetSys](#MetSys)
  - [Pandora](#Pandora)
  - [Phantom Camera](#PhantomCamera)
- Mine
  - [Bones](#Bones)
  - [Log.gd](#Log-gd)

## GDUnit

A super solid Godot unit test framework - includes a companion github action
workflow!

There is also GUT, but I've found I prefer GDUnit's handling of certain
crash-situations. (#TODO link issue/thread)

## MetSys

A solid set of building blocks for creating Metroidvanias in Godot. Check it out!

## Pandora

> I adopted Pandora before fully understanding Godot's Custom Resources - so
> lately I try to go as far as I can with those before bringing in the
> full-Pandora experience.

Pandora provides some excellent UX improvements to Custom Resources, with the
added bonus of managing _entities_ and derived _instances_ of those entities.
It's quite nice!

## Phantom Camera

All kinds of camera features that you'll want, available out of the box, and
reasonably customizable. Check it out!

# Mine

> Bias warning!

These are addons I wrote and maintain, and that generally get added every
project I work on.

## Log.gd

A `print()` replacement that adds colors to Godot's output window. Includes a
prefix with the script and line number that made the call.

## Bones

A suite of addons that I pulled out of Dino. Should perhaps be broken down
further at some point - but I'm letting these tools evolve a bit first.
