## The Tale (May 10 2025)

hope y'all are doing well!

i'm feeling crazed but ambitious + in good spirits after a busy few weeks. I got
married! And then did a weekend in the catskills with a bunch of nerdy
musicians, and then went to Godot Con Boston! What?! Yeah.

We got back Thursday, today is Saturday. I just spent days writing todos but
trying really hard not to commit to any of them. Wish me luck!

Godot Con was great! I met a bunch of cool godot nerds, and there were some
crazy games, look at this one:

I think I was staring wide-eyed at someone else playing this game for a full
minute before Space Orca turns to me to say: "Do you wanna play?"

"YES." I say as calmly as an excited oldest child can.

Space Orca hit some dev-ghost keybindings while I stomped around, ate burritos,
and batted away trash to a gorgeous island sunset. Suddenly, the sky is filled
with secret BSPs

- The first day i concentrated on godot <> mobile/osx things
  - someone recreated the godot editor as an ipad app
    - inexplicably called `Xogot` :eyeroll:
  - swiftgodot and swiftgodotkit are two related libraries for godot->ios things (embedding)
