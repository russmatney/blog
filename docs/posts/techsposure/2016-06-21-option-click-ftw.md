###*TL;DR*:

Rather than a plan click and drag, if you hold option, it will create a copy of
the file rather than move the original.

I didn't know i needed it!

Use-cases:

  - Copying a folder with a project or application to start a new one based on the old
  - Creating a sharable album of photos without deconstructing the original
  - Simple version control: option + drag and drop to create a quick copy anywhere

Don't forget you can click and drag across [Hot Corners](/techsposure/hot-damn-hot-corners/), while using [Gestures](/techsposure/gestures/), or while [fast-app-switching](/techsposure/winning-with-windows)
