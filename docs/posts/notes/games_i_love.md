Games have always been a passion of mine - I love finding games in which the
devs made something they wanted to play, something that didn't adhere to some
generic idea of what a game should be. As a result I love indie games and tend
to abhor games with large budgets but bankrupt creativity.

I hope to continue to pull the likes/themes over to the gaming magna cartas.
