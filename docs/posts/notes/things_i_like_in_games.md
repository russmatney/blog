This might make for a good devlog.

Inspired by NaNoWriMo's "magna carta"s, this is a list of things in games that
I've liked.

They are here as inspiration, motivation, and as a tribute. I hope to
borrow/steal/remix/create with this, to give my own games a bit of the joy these
brought me.

These should help step towards the principles I care about in games. What themes
are threaded through all these?

# alley oops

Since the latest superstrikers, i've wanted to do some kind of arch-ing shot one
on one game. It's all about that alley-oop, that whipping half-court shot.

- Super Mario Strikers
# come-from-behind victories
- Mario Kart via items thunder, red-shell
- NBA Jam via shifting stats/probabilities
# capture the flag
running with the flag, chasing the other team's carrier...

it helps to have a feel for the current state of the game
