# Games Portfolio

> I started solo-deving on games full time in July of 2022.
>
> My first year was all about game jams - I mostly worked in one monorepo
> (russmatney/dino), from which I submitted 10+ (tiny) games and worked as many
> tools and prototypes.
>
> In my second year, I pushed for steam releases. `Dot Hop` launched on
> March 2024, and `Dino` launched a few months later in June.
>
> In the second half of 2024, I pushed for more collaboration! I led Team
> Moonstorm through the launch of `Rapid Eye Madness` in late October as part of
> the Indie Game Academy's Level 3 program.
>
> In November, I built `Carving with Care` with Cat Tale Games - more to come on
> that in Q1 2025!

# Launched

Below I'll dig into each game, grouped by team.

## Danger Russ Games

Once a silly name for my solo-dev work, now a fully fledge one-person LLC!

> Beyond the games listed here, there are more games and prototypes available on
> [my itch.io page](https://russmatney.itch.io).

### Dot Hop

A short puzzle game. Try to find a path connecting all the dots!

Dot Hop launched with 72 puzzles (12 on 6 'worlds'). I hope to increase this
number on a per season basis, once I'm past the mobile release.

Originally implemented as a PuzzleScript game called [Flower Eater](https://russmatney.itch.io/flower-eater).

```

### Dino

Dino started as a Godot monorepo. It has featured several games and prototypes,
including a small metroidvania
([hatbot](https://russmatney.itch.io/mvania19-web)), some platformer and top
down experiments ([shirt](https://russmatney.itch.io/shirt),
[spike](https://russmatney.itch.io/spike), etc), a short beat em up ([super
elevator level](https://russmatney.itch.io/super-elevator-level-web)), and even an
early version of Dot Hop.

> I covered this early phase of Dino in a video devlog: [Dino 'So Far'](https://youtu.be/9cyAnNLGrZI)

In the build-up to Dino's launch, the mechanics from these games were
refactored into reusable components. Dino launched with a few game modes
supported by some basic procedural level generation.

Next up: creating and honing the content - I'm recreating some of the original
game jam ideas using the proc-gen system, and toying with various player and
enemy mechanics.

Dino is a convenient sandbox for prototyping both mechanics and game libraries.
It had several Godot addons, which have so far been
broken out into [Log.gd](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd) and [Bones](https://github.com/russmatney/bones).

```
Status: Launched
Platform: Steam

# In-progress

### Glossolalia

A Godot Metroidvania, coming in 2025.

```
Status: In development
Engine: Godot
Tools: FMOD
```

### Blox

So far, Blox is a tetris and puyo-puyo implementation.

The next step is to prototype a few different ideas:

- "Lazy Tetris"
  - removing a the time-pressure component
  - Would a 'clicker' tetris be a fun 'background' game?
- "Balatro-Tetris"
  - Applying deckbuilder roguelike mechanics to some tried and true block-faller
    games
- "Set Tetris"
  - a block faller with rules similar to 'Set'

I'm not making enough time for this project at the moment :/

```
Status: Prototype on itch.io
Next step: Prototype Roguelike mechanics
Engine: Godot
```

### Beat Em Up City

For a long time I was calling this "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Beat Em Up",
and other times a "perpetual" beat em up.

The idea is a sort of Animal Crossing <> Beat Em Up - an idea that makes sense
in some ways and is kind of crazy in others. Move to an apartment in the big
city, meet your neighbors, defend your territory, build up your reputation!

Probably too early to share! More to come soon.

```
Status: In development
Next step: Hone Beat Em Up fighting mechanics
Engine: Godot
```
