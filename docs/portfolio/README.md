### Games

I've released a few games on steam and a bunch more on itch.

Check out some favorites: [Games](/portfolio/games.md)

### Open Source Tools and Addons

Most of my games and addons are open source, feel free to read the code!

I also maintain several productivity tools, mostly written with Clojure.
