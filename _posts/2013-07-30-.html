new bootstrap (rc1) avail. for a nice changelog, check out the pull request: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/6342 they're dropping the fluid vs non-fluid system in favor of making everything responsive, and changing quite a few naming conventions: <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">.span* to .col-* and .hero-unit to .jumbotron. but that's nothing we can't relearn. right guys?</span>
