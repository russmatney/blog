Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Here's what I've found useful in the last few weeks.

For anyone making web color scheme decisions, the <a title="Color Scheme Designer" href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/" target="_blank">Color Scheme Designer</a> lets you pick a number of colors and includes "Light" and "Dark" layout examples right on the site.

<a title="UI-Cloud" href="http://ui-cloud.com/" target="_blank">UI-Cloud</a> is a search engine full of User Interface elements. Pretty amazing if you're looking for inspiration or an idea of what other people are doing.

<a title="Swiffy" href="https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/" target="_blank">Swiffy</a> is a Flash Professional add-on that allows you to output most Flash .swfs as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's super easy and powerful, and lately has saved a lot of development time on interactive pieces.

<a title="Mixpanel" href="https://mixpanel.com/" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a> is an online analytics platform with event-based listeners available for integration with basically everything it should (Javascript, iPhone, Android, ActionScript, Python, PHP, Ruby). It is simple to implement (so far) and I'm hoping it's easy to organize.

I had an issue implementing <a title="jQuery UI" href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">jQuery UI</a> touches on Mobile Safari on the iPad last week, but I found a nice solution: <a title="Touch Punch" href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/" target="_blank">Touch Punch</a> is a plug-in that converts (most? all?) touches to clicks. A cleverer or less-busy developer might be able to apply this solution to other issues.

The last few weeks, I've been taking strides toward becoming a well-rounded developer. I've been diving into the proper use of <a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and learning the ropes of codebase version control through <a title="Git" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a> and <a title="Apache SVN" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" target="_blank">svn</a>. This has necessitated a barely-working knowledge of the dreaded <a title="Terminal Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(Mac_OS_X)" target="_blank">Terminal</a> and the beginnings of <a title="Vim WIki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)" target="_blank">Vim</a>. I need to learn all of these things quickly and properly, and, as always, the best way to do that is to dive in. So, I'll sink or swim, and let you know what resources I find along the way.
