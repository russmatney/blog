Somewhere in between Brooklyn and Manhattan, a window on the C Train flickered into a mirror that reflected the viewer’s beauty. Everyone on the car stared, and then started slowly posing in front it, watching the beautiful reflection of their bodies and faces, looking fabulous.

The car slowly filled up, and no one got off. No one could look away from the mirror, and soon no one could move at all, because the car was so packed.

Those people are still there. If you ride the C, be careful of that train, and that car. We couldn’t pry them away.
