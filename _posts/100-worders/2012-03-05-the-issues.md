She was sipping gin in the bathtub, fully clothed, lying on top of the magazines. Some would call her a hoarder, but really the tub was only half-full. The issues conformed to her shape so closely that they could have been arranged that way. And besides, she wanted to read all of them. Eventually.

She thought about her next story. Would it begin here, in the bathtub, on the magazines? Would the gin help? Perhaps more gin would. She poured a fresh glass.

Her husband appeared in the doorway. “Working again, I see."

"Harder than ever." She took another sip.
