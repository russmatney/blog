I always find it at Chambers. Where I lose it, I don’t know.

I usually notice it’s gone at the bar. I approach someone or I bump into the prettiest girl coming out of the bathroom. I figure my knobby hands or my rake of hair sends her off. Then I realize that it’s missing.

At Chambers, my mojo cowers under a bench. I shoo the people away and say sweet things to it to coax it out. Then I nab it, strangle it, and swallow it right there. Don’t even wash my hands. 

It always finds a way out.
