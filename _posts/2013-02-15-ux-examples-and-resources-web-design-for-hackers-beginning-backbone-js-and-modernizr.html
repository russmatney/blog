What's up, code monkeys? Another post, another slew of things I loved and would love to share with you.

There are a handful of websites collecting and glorifying examples of great web interaction. <a title="Small Nudges" href="http://www.smallnudg.es/" target="_blank">Small Nudges</a> focuses on ways businesses are nudging users toward conversion. <a title="Little Big Details" href="http://littlebigdetails.com/" target="_blank">Little Big Details</a> and <a title="Pattern Tap" href="http://patterntap.com/" target="_blank">Pattern Tap</a> bring us great examples of user interaction. I may have mentioned <a title="UI Cloud" href="http://ui-cloud.com/" target="_blank">UI Cloud</a> before, but it belongs in this group, as it is essentially a search engine for UI elements. Web design is getting cleaner, faster, and more intuitive as we continue to raise the bar, and these sites are a great place to check in on the latest trends.

If you're not a designer, (I'm definitely not) there are still great ways to learn and contribute to the design of any project, even for you logic-based, nerd-alert programmers who spend hours each day staring at, basically, the matrix. Exposure to great sites like <a title="smashing magazine" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a title="Web Design Depot" href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/" target="_blank">Web Design Depot</a>, and <a title="CSS-Tricks" href="http://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a> are always great (and just look at how well-designed <em>they</em> are!) I recommend their newsletters very much, because they filter for you. Let them pick the good ones out before you overwhelm yourself.

Another great site is <a title="Sidebar" href="http://sidebar.io/" target="_blank">Sidebar</a>, which gives you no more than the 5 best design links of the day, or if you sign of up for their weekly email, the 7 best of the week. I have yet to be disappointed. Also, check out <a title="Hack Design" href="http://hackdesign.org/" target="_blank">Hack Design</a>. I haven't had time to dive in yet, but it seems to be something like a crash course in design for all those coders who ran through <a title="codecademy" href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.

I learned to implement <a title="Modernizr" href="http://modernizr.com/" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> for the first time last week at work, and was oh-so-impressed. It solves all kinds of browser css issues that I've been so afraid of for so long. Now I feel you can truly design for the latest-and-greatest Chrome, and patch IE later. I hope that's not too naive. I think the catch is that it works best with a really well-designed front-end. We got it going without much trouble.

For you hard-core coders, I am really enjoying working with <a title="Backbone" href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>. It was complicated at first, but it is making more and more sense lately. Check out this <a title="Hangman tutorial" href="http://trivektor.wordpress.com/category/backbone-js/" target="_blank">hangman tutorial</a>. I ran through it a few days ago and loved the exposure to a Ruby server using <a title="Sinatra" href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" target="_blank">Sinatra</a>. I'm hoping to get <a title="Heroku" href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> involved this weekend so I can push my own hangman game live. So much to learn!

P.S. A friend of mine is diving into programming now, and he's finding great things on coding-related subreddits, including <a title="Squishy toggle buttons" href="http://codepen.io/soulwire/full/bKens" target="_blank">these squishy toggle buttons</a>. I'm sure there's wonderful stuff there, if you're looking for more.
