That girl? You don’t wanna dance with that girl. She’s got leftover feet. Man feet. Clumsy, stinky ones.

That beer? You don’t wanna drink that beer. Gordo drinks that beer. They soak it in gym socks before they let the monkeys swim in it.

That seat? You don’t wanna sit in that seat. My grandfather died in that seat. And my grandmother. They looked just like you.

That burger? You don’t wanna eat that burger. Lemme take it off your hands.

Thab book? Iths predy goob acthually. (Gulp) Wait, did you say this one? You don’t wanna read this one.
