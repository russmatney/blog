Saturday, on the A train.
He got on around Canal or Chambers, and said his name was John Hennessy.
His teeth were askew and he looked more like a Cargo Jeffries,
but was quite well-spoken.
He said he makes his living with his words and he'd appreciate anything we could
give.

I couldn't hear over the noise of the car,
but I saw the words hit the people.
Slowly at first, then some stirred.
They looked around, like waking up.
One raised her eyebrows,
then there was a change in her eyes.
After a time,
her brain exploded.
