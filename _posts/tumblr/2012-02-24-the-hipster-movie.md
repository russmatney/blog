Things overheard from hipsters outside a hipster movie:
“Yeah, I guess I would say it was… good.”
“I really liked the idea of the movie. I didn’t like the movie itself, but, the idea of the movie, that I liked.”
“When are all these hipsters going to stop wearing all these hipster clothes? Oh thanks, these are custom-made converse. My Dad works at Nike.”
“It was basically a knock-off the Great Gatsby combined with a knock-off of that knock-off of the Great Gatsby we saw last week.”
“I really would have enjoyed that, if it wasn’t for all the hipsters.”
