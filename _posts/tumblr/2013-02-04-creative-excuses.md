I’m asked to be creative everyday. This morning, it’s what to do about underwear, three days after what should have been laundry Sunday.
Sunglasses on the subway – twin shields, bold first lines of defense against the eye contact of the general public.
The second line is staring at your phone or shoes or that eww on the ground.
The third is headphones, even if they’re not on. They remove your senses from the context of the train, and you can excuse interaction as dancing or wandering-pseudo-music-video eyes.
The fourth? Reused underpants. No one is looking at me at all.
