It’s funny when someone you run into remembers you, and you don’t. You nod and squint and ask if they are sure just short of too many times. Ha ha ha, right?
But it’s funnier when they are lying and just feel like talking or making a new friend on the train.
"You don’t know me from that thing? At Dave’s?" They speak very loudly. “Yeah, I know that was you. You sat in the guacamole and the dog wouldn’t stop sniffing your butt! HAHAHA! You don’t remember? Oh it was too funny."
Now the whole train thinks you’re Guac-butt.
