It’s funny how people grow apart.
I met her at a bar, like any other chick. She was drinking Magic Hat. Fine by me.
Months later, it’s funny how we’re still together. We laugh. It really came out of nowhere.
I’m not a “the one" guy, but can you meet “the one" at a bar? Does that happen?
What if I had never gone, or been in the bathroom, or if someone else met her first?
Anyway, we haven’t spoken in a few years. I guess by now I could say it’s funny. I’m not sure what else to say.
