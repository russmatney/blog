I wish I could stack the deck on my commute.

People who are lucky – their lives play out like stacked decks. All express stops to the next purple.

My little sister used to stack the deck in Candy Land, which was totally fine. We’re 9 years apart, and I didn’t really want to play anyway. ‘If we could wrap this whole thing up in about five minutes, that’d be great. Winner cleans up.’

You can be lucky too, if you want. Or, at least appear to be. Reset your expectations and realign your goals based on the most recent results.
