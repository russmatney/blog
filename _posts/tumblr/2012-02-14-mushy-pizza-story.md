It isn’t easy to sell pizza, especially to people who don’t order it. But my “Surprise! Door-to-Door Pizza Delivery!” enterprise certainly does save on gas. Especially in apartment buildings.
It was in one such building that I met my Jane. It was Valentine’s Day, and although she hadn’t ordered a pizza, she had placed a spiritual order for a “real” man. I opened the door and she swept me inside, praising the Good Lord for His Delivery.
Years later, things haven’t changed much. Every Valentine’s, Jane and I watch Finding Nemo and pig out on candy. And we love it.
