She had that wide-legged power-stance, Subway balance without handlebars. Impressive. 

She pushed her hair behind her ears, and I saw black nail polish. A sign of either attitude or sexiness. I poked her in the back to ask, but was ignored. Must be sexiness. Sexy girls never like the cool guys.

I’m one of the cool guys. I wear plaid flannel and big headphones. I like thick scarves and deep scars.

When you see me on the train, or feel me poke you in the back, you should know, I’m not listening to anything. I just like wearing the headphones.
