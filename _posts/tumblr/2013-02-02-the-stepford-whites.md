“I told you moving here was a bad idea. When it doesn’t stink, it tastes like paste.”
“Oh hush. You’re always aching.”
“And it’s creepy! Something feels… off. I’m not sure what.”
“Oh relax. What could be wrong?”
“I don’t know. Isn’t it weird we haven’t seen any babies in so long? It’s been years!”
“Well, there’s just no room, is there? Where would they go?”
“And, call me crazy, but something has happened to Betsy.”
“Like what?”
“I don’t know… since I woke up from my nap this morning, she’s been… false.”
“Honey, I think you’ve gone completely dental.”
