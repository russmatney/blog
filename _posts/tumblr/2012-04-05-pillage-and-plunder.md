There was a Viking going door-to-door, looking for his skateboard. He needed to get to school on time, but he couldn’t remember where he’d left it.
The Viking couldn’t be late for school today. He was already in trouble with Miss Crabtree for pillaging the sea of desks. And besides, he had a math test that morning.
At the third door, a small girl told him she’d seen it down the street near the sewer. She showed him where, and the Viking fished it out with his horned helmet.
"Good luck on the test."
"Thanks little girl," said the Viking.
