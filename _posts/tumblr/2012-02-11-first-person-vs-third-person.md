I carry baggage.

Henry Thompson doesn’t.

I launch the story into blissful abyss, or drag it down emotionally.

Henry Thompson has a very nice pleasant time, or a rather uncomfortable evening.

I don’t mind telling you personal secrets about myself. In fact, they’re really not secrets at all, because you’re inside my head. I’m really just thinking.

Henry Thompson is embarrassed to share certain things, like the time he was caught in the Girls’ bathroom by accident in 5th grade. He doesn’t mind too much though, because he understands the need to open up, for the sake of the story.
