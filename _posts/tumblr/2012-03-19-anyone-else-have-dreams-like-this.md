I used to know them.
They had dated on and off, and now they came to me in a dream, where you can never quite think properly.
There were tears in their eyes.
"We’re running away" they said, as if they were going to elope.
"Oh. Wow," I said. 
"We ran away," they said, as if from a car crash.
"Oh wow," I said.
"They ran away," they said, as if they were hit in the car crash.
"Oh, wow," I said. 
“Put that gun away,” they said, pointing to the gun.
“Oh.” I looked down at my hands. “Wow.”
