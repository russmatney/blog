A waddling waddler waddled past me onto the train this morning. She sat down with a group of penguins twittering madly on their phones. They were headed north.

It’s funny how penguins sit. They have almost no legs, so really they can only stand, but they had the bench on the car, so I called it sitting.
I wanted to ask where they were from, where they were going, how they had gotten here, why they were visiting New York. But I figured they got that all the time. I didn’t want to bother them, so I went to work.
