Says one side: “Anything designed to kill and be concealed should be illegal."

Says the other: “The state has no right to limit the self-defense of its citizens."
Years later: Things are mostly the same. Self-defense has reached an all-time high. We’ve got four nuclear warheads in the kitchen, next to the stove. We’re careful not to bump into them. My wife doesn’t like them, but that’s a low price for peace of mind. A new set is being installed in every classroom at school next month. I sleep much better knowing they are there.
You know, just in case.
