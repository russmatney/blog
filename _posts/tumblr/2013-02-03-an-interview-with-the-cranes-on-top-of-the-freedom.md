<strong>How did you get all the way up here?</strong>

Mel: I wanted to be a swan, but I was born here instead.

Gilgamesh: Elevator.

<strong>What’s your favorite part of the day?</strong>

Mel: Pretending to be a swan.

Gilgamesh: Sunset.

<strong>How does it feel to be working on the Freedom Tower?</strong>

Mel: I’d have been a prouder swan.

Gilgamesh: Ironic.

<strong>Play any music while you work?</strong>

Mel: Swan Lake.

Gilgamesh: No.

<strong>What are you going to do next?</strong>

Mel: Swan dive.

Gilgamesh: (shrugs) Taxi-driver?

<strong>Anything else?</strong>

Mel: Nope.

Gilgamesh: Advice for the weary: The opposite of love isn’t hate, it’s indifference.
