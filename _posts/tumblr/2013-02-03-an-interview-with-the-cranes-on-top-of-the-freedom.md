How did you get all the way up here?
Mel: I wanted to be a swan, but I was born here instead.
Gilgamesh: Elevator.
What’s your favorite part of the day?
Mel: Pretending to be a swan.
Gilgamesh: Sunset.
How does it feel to be working on the Freedom Tower?
Mel: I’d have been a prouder swan.
Gilgamesh: Ironic.
Play any music while you work?
Mel: Swan Lake.
Gilgamesh: No.
What are you going to do next?
Mel: Swan dive.
Gilgamesh: (shrugs) Taxi-driver?
Anything else?
Mel: Nope.
Gilgamesh: Advice for the weary: The opposite of love isn’t hate, it’s indifference.
