Blind date: Christian. Is he Christian? Or is that his name? Never met a boy named Jewish.

Needs. Girls: Air conditioning and Hair conditioning. Medieval Princes: Heir conditioning.

That local elderly marching band is exactly as funny to watch as you think it is.

A germ-detecting super hero’s sidekick is a cat in a Cat-in-the-Hat hat. They always catch a cold and their culprit, who is that fat bat that sat and spat on my friend pat.

In a world where Prince Charming doubles as the Tooth Fairy. Me: “Dweamth dooo come twoo!” Prince Fairy: “Not quite. Here’s a nickel.”
