I was leaving for work when I remembered to brush my teeth at the last minute, and it was a good thing. Two steps out the door, the teeth-brushing police were in full force, grabbing random jaws for inspection.
Fresh and minty breathers got a slap on the cheek and a box of floss, those who ate after they brushed were ruffed-up a bit and fined a few crowns, and the morning breathers… well, I’m glad I remembered.
There have been stories. Bad ones. Usually ending with nasty pulls and giant drills.
Which reminds me. I need to shave tonight.
