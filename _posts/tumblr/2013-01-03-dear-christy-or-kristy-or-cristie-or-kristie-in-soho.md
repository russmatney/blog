Dear Christy or Kristy or Cristie or Kristie in SoHo,

You said my name was old school. I appreciate it. Old school sounds so cool. Chucks, short-shorts, Magic Johnson.

Is it stupid to think that I’ll see you again, in a city with so many people?

Fate does not approach the passive, and random chance is totally random.

But a city with this many people has got to have some magic. People pass thoughts and moods along, from one apartment to another. Extra-sensory ebb and flow from Brooklyn to SoHo.

Our good-bye was like a hello. Thanks for your name.
