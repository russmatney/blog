Been becoming more and more aware of myself, yet increasingly less conscious. The train is full and slow and fading, and I found a new favorite seat.
These real-life characters are evolving with the weather. Samba stripes take on every color. Heels become boots. Jackets pin more and more to their lapels. Smartphones multiply like gravestones during wartime.
I think, I wonder what if, well, itâ€™s a stupid idea. But: what if all these headphones were playing the same song?
The shakes and squeaks on the train are in tune. Listen to the revs, the thuds. Watch the people dance.
