My room was a COMPLETE pigsty (no exaggeration) until this portal to hell opened up right in the middle of it.

At first it was a few inches wide, but it’s growing. Now it’s a few feet across. I have to hop around it in some places.
Anyway, the rest of my room is clean. My desk: spotless. My shelves: organized. My bed: untouched. Which makes sense, as I haven’t been sleeping well, what with all the noise. Desperate begging, screams, wailing, gnashing of teeth, that whole bit.
It’s pretty remarkable. You should come see it. Just watch your step.
