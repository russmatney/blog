Pretend everyone is trying to decide whether they like pink or blue cotton candy more.

Pretend everyone is dancing in rhythm like at a party.
Pretend everyone is trying to use ESP, and then figure out what they are saying.
Pretend everyone else is trying really hard to not fart.
Pretend everyone else knows magic, but they aren’t allowed to tell you or they’ll go to wizard jail.
Pretend everyone missed their stop three stops ago but no one wants to admit it.
Pretend everyone secretly watches Martha Stewart online at work, and can’t wait to see the next episode.
