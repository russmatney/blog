They put me in a corner, by the freight elevator, and told me to answer the phone. Soon it rang, so I picked up.
It didn’t go well. There was a voice on the other end, but I couldn’t hear it over the elevator.
Soon I had a steady paycheck, so I kept going, listening to the little voices, never quite hearing them.
Then one day I missed the call. It rang twice, then stopped.
They didn’t fire me. I quit.
Now I’m making calls to a freight company. No matter how loud I yell, they can never hear me.
