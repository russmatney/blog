Joe owned no phone, but wandered the C-train talking on a Bluetooth earpiece. The subway regulars knew all his girls: his dramatic ex-girlfriend, his half-sister in Idaho, his niece who loved Barbie.
Joe only talked to one man: Benny, an investor with diverse assets that touched every angle of the consumer market: medical devices, sporting equipment, advertising, television, retail. Benny’s wealth was economy-proof. He continued to grow, reading the market and making bold, successful moves. Nothing could stop him.
Nothing except for Joe, who dropped the earpiece between the train and platform at the 23rd street station. Mind the gap.
