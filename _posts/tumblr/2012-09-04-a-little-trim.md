Couples, like eyebrows, should be more or less the same thickness and shape.

If one of two is a little twisted, it’s quirky. If both are, it’s Jack Nicholson crazy.

They should be surprised or angry at about the same time. If just one of them is, the other needs to pull the first back down to earth.

If they’re too far apart, it’s sad and a little scary. If they’re too close together, it’s just weird and uncomfortable for everyone else.

Most of the time they should be growing, but every once in a while, they need a trim.
