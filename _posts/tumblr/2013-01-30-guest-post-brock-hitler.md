The Nazis won. Hitler’s men marched across Europe, crushing Stalin’s defenses in a grand, orchestrated sweep. Towers fell; all knew the taste of oppression, bitter German steel.As the years went on, Hitler mellowed out a lot. He’d really just been going through a bad time in the 40s. Once the 60s rolled around, he was pretty approachable, not a bad guy to be around.The Producers still got made, even though this is an alternate timeline. Hitler loved it, and invited Mel Brooks to his birthday party in the Eagle’s Nest. Their friendship lasted until Hitler’s death in 1982.
