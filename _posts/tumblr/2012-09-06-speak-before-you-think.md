The artist that changed the world wasn’t known when he was alive.
A girl across the tracks makes eyes at you. You think, “Maybe if she were here…."
What if you’d met the artist? What if you sat next to him on the train two days ago, or right now? If that girl stood next to you, would you even look at her?
Soon you’ll wake up and all the time will be gone. You’ll hear the ding and watch the doors close.
Make choices, not excuses.
Life is a bicycle. Lean forward and keep pedaling or you’ll fall over.
