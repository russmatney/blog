Is there a rule about asking a girl out while she’s working? Romantic-comedies make me sick, so if there’s a rule, someone needs to tell me.

She’s pretty and nice, and the pizza here is really good. I asked.

She said no, she has a boyfriend. Which is fine. I’m terrified of commitment and pretty busy anyway and thanks for everything and see you around and oh crap I already paid for the pizza.

Now, Lovefool is blaring. I’m the only customer in the restaurant, and I just asked the girl at the register if I could buy her coffee.
