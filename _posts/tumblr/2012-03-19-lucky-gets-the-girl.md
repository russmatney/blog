I never thought I’d get a girl. Either I’m stupid or I just don’t think.

Then one day, it happened on the subway. She had a mouth, telling people to look her way and roll their eyes one more goddamn time and see what happens.
She said something to me, but I wasn’t listening, I just kept on singing the song in my headphones.
And that was it. She followed me off the train and made me buy her a sandwich and a soda.
You could say I’m a pretty lucky guy, but you don’t need to. I already know.
