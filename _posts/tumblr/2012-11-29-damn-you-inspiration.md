Inspiration comes in the night.

It’s where I look, where you might 
find
me tumbling along a crooked road
bartering unmatched socks with a toad 
who
soaked his pair in the pond, on the pad
then hopped upfor a lad
to
trade in the shade, with a smirk.
but this switch made no jerk
be
cause (in this dream) I love unmatched socks
so much I’d hand this toad flocks of rocks
with-
gold-flecked dots and mushroom-
shaped spots, fit for a groom,
out
on his day (or her’s), or any day.
perhaps to-day, butreally,
first.
i go to bed.
