title: Generix is perfectly safe

I’m at work. My lungs are burning, my muscles are weak, and my headache is blaring.
Some big name pharmaceutical companies, desperate to fill their clinical trials, have turned to testing the copywriters at their ad agencies. 
You’d think they would grab the interns first. Sadly, it’s still spring.
Oh, here comes the doctor.  
"I think I’m dying," I tell him.
"Nonsense. Generix is perfectly safe. Besides, you were in the control group." He smiled. “Your pill was only sugar."
I coughed and gagged, “I’m allergic to sugar!"
As I died, he said: “Well, this will certainly skew the results."
