We had a band called The Ugly Bros. It started as a joke. The five of us were conductors for the subway, and we’d play in different stations on our breaks. People liked us pretty well, I guess.

Pretty soon there were too many people to have the concerts underground, so we started setting up in parks around the city.
Our biggest fans were homeless people and small children. Neither grouped seemed to mind the other, except for the kids’ parents.
We were the voice of the people. We played anything and everything. We mostly played with chopsticks on trashcans.
