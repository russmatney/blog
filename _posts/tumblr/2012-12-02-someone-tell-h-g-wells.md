Sometimes you walk into a room, or a restaurant, and you’re the only one there, and suddenly the moment steps outside of time. You hold your breath and your brain and watch are on hold.
That’s where I found The Time Traveler. He was eating an Italian sub on the Lower East Side on a Saturday night.
I watched him while I ordered. He didn’t do much. He watched the roaming packs, taking notes in a tiny little book.
I had to ask. “Time Traveler, what are you doing here?”
He thought for a moment, then said. “Pausing, between worlds.”
