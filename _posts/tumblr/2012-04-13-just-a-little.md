What do you think, where are you from, where are you going? I want to know what movies you watch or what books you read, but more than that, what part you’re on, how you feel about it, how it makes you feel. We are all a million miles deep, or close to it, and we all have this shared experience everyday. Why can’t we talk about it, figure it out, show some support, not as anything more than some people riding in the same car? 
Come on, guys. We’re not just commuting, are we? Let’s hang out a little.
