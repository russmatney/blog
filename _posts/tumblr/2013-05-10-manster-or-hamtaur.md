This is the story of an extreme girlfriend that wanted her boyfriend to look into scientific procedures for shrinking and merging his body with a hamsterâ€™s in order to carry him around in her pocket and call him Hamster Huey, and of the grotesque boyfriend that resulted thereof. These are some of the activities they did together afterwards:
Skiing
Couples-counseling for partial-human relationships
Snowboarding
Mountain biking
Couples-counseling for incompatible relationships
Skydiving
Couples-counseling for single-income relationships
Complicated and expensive legal-proceedings related to side-effects of experimental surgery
Couples-counseling for disproportionately-sized relationships
Regular physical therapy and ritual anti-inflammatory medicinal intake
General couples-counseling
Surfing.
