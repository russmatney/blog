A new trend is emerging among middle to high schoolers: an offshoot of the “emo" fashion made popular several years ago by bands such as HIM and The Used, the new “retardo" culture reimagines emo’s themes of edgy loneliness. The big difference? Where “emo" focuses on themes of self-harm, depression, and even suicide, “retardos" see themselves as simply inept, falling short of the social standard – particularly regarding intellectual pursuits. Fashion-wise, children in the retardo “scene" wear helmets and stained sweatpants, cross their eyes, and maintain a slack-jawed expression. Some use permanent markers to draw strings of drool on their chins.
