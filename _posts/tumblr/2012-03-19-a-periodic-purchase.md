The day I saved the world I was at Walmart looking at shower curtains. I went because my wife wouldn’t stop nagging.
They had all kinds. Too many, if you ask me. I bought one called: “Periodic Table of the Elements.” Thought it would piss her off the most.
Weeks later, my son ran into my room, toilet paper stuck to his shoe, asking about Hydrogen and Helium. Years later, he graduated from MIT. He won a Nobel Prize for Biology. His letter said he had solved cancer with “Recombinant double-stranded RNA.”
I’m just glad the thing was on sale.
