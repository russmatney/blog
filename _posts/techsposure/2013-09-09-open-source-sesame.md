open-source: dive in.
github resumes
testing
team-experience vs. building in a silo
contributing to the greater good, man.
get involved in the conversation and direction
best practices
don't make me go all UNCLE BOB on your code-monkey ass
exposure to different languages and frameworks

how to get involved
code triage


what i'm hoping to get time for: 
batmanjs
ngprogress
etc

another loose goal:
all open source:
build an npm module
build a ruby gem
build a grunt-contrib (you know I love grunt)
build an angular directive
bower?
jquery plugin
wordpress plugin
