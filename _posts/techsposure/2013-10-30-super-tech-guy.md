###*TL;DR*:

How to learn to be a super(tech)hero,
and why it's important.
Basically: Go get exposure to tech, 
then use it to save the world.

---

If you talk to me about programming,
you've heard me plug 
[Uncle Bob's talk on clean code and professionalism in Tech]().
I just re-watched it with my new-to-web-dev brother, and 
I've seen it a few times now.
One of my favorite points is the need for defining and improving professionalism in our industry.

For the rest of the world, our code is a black-box that only we understand.
We are like wizards with magic powers, sorcerers that make things go when clicked. 
This is awesome! But it implies some negatives:
if something goes terribly wrong, the rest of the world (or company)
will grab their pitch-forks and torches and start up the witch-hunt.
Uncle Bob (and common sense) tell us there will be such disasters,
something terrible will happen, and lives will be lost.
What will we have to say for ourselves?
We need to develop and enforce clean code, 
protecting ourselves from mistakes,
and pass these learnings onto the empowered young programmers
that are constantly entering the workforce.

Those best-practices seem pretty important.
How do we figure out what they are?

I've been programming full-time for a year and a half-ish; right now,
I fall somewhere between noob and mentor.
Somewhere along the way, 
those Intro-to-JavaScript sites 
like [Codecademy]() or [CodeSchool]()
become less and less valuable as I gain more and more experience.
What I need now isn't in a specific language's syntax or frameworks, 
I need the big-picture architecture help,
more experience with testing and documentation,
advice around prioritization of security issues,
stuff that needs some back-and-forth to figure out.
Where do I get that?

[where to go once you're over the first hill video from that girl]()

Here's a list of things that will anyone along in that direction. 

###Get a mentor

By far the most efficient as well as the most elusive solution.
Working side by side with another dev is the quickest way to scale the initial learning curve (which, by the way, is a big one).
The trouble with this is, of course, finding one.
This could warrant a full post, but for now: go to meetups and coffeeshops and check out the rest of this list if you're on the hunt. 
Once you do, camp out under that learning tree.

###Be a mentor

You don't have to be an expert in anything to help somebody out. 
Engineering is just problem-solving. 
If you're having trouble getting help on something,
go find someone working on a related task and help them out. 

Btw, the best debugging advice I know of is just reading error codes.
Most things try to tell you what they did wrong,
and googling an error code is the best way to start getting through any issue.

###At least find a hacking buddy

Work with someone in person, even if it's on different projects. 
This blog is called Techsposure because it's all about exposure to Tech;
I believe exposure is the most important part of learning
- understanding can come later, but you never get there without the first exposure.

###Write about it

[StackOverflow has a great post]() about asking the Rubber duck before asking anyone else for help.
Defining or explaining the problem you are having organizes your brain, 
and often leads you to the answer.

Blogging and writing works the same. 
Go write a little something about a new piece of tech you just discovered,
especially one you don't fully understand.
You'll end up defining for yourself exactly what you know and don't know,
and deepen your understanding of the big picture.

Forget publishing and feedback and what the world thinks - this is for you. 
You are essentially mentoring yourself (and any other lucky readers, if you publish it),
and reaping the benefits of teaching the new material.

###Guest Blogging!

Same benefits, larger audience. Most blogs are literally asking for it.

###Pro Tips!

Twitter, [CoderWall](), etc. Lots of places for very helpful little tid-bits.

[needs examples]()

###Lightning Speeches!

I'm terrified of these and have never done one,
but I KNOW it will be good for me and that it's a great way to break into giving longer talks.
Speaking of which...

###Give some talks!

Like blogging about something you just learned,
but with higher stakes: more pressure and fear to get over, but a much greater reward.

###Meetups and Hackathons

Google it. Duh.

[needs examples.]()

###Open-Source Contributing!

You don't have to be in a big tech city at a meetup or hackathon to work with great people or on great projects.
Dive into open-source everything!
Check out [this post]() for more details.()
[this]() was a great post on using documentation as an entry point to some awesome open-source projects.

###Book reading? 

Some people like to read books on code - I haven't had a ton of success with it yet
(I'm a big fan of reading blogs and writing code as soon as possible).
The exception to this for me will likely be an entrance to functional programming via 
[Learn blahdlhdlsaj haskell for great good]().

###Online reading!

I love my email subscriptions and [pocket]() for reading blogs offline. 
My reading workflow is basically filtering headlines via email and adding them to pocket 
as I have time.
What blogs/email subscriptions, you ask?

These:

- list 'em
- 

Other people like RSS, which I'm told is awesome these days. [link here?]()

###Networking!

It's easy enough to trade twitter handles with people you meet. 
A strong network is very valuable,
especially when there is so much demand for quality code.
Remember, recruiting is very hard for both sides,
and it's always better to hire the right people at the wrong time
than to be scrambling when you need lots of code in a hurry.

###Ask why and be opinionated

[that girl's talk]() that i grabbed screenshots from

Forming an opinion about different parts of your system or different languages and frameworks is crucial. 
Stay open-minded, of course, but bringing your own ideas to the table is your job.
Anyone can write that code once the architecture is designed.

###Katas!

As always, keep your workflow and your problem-solving skills sharp. 
[Codewars]() and [underPressure]() are great for small scale, 
but you can go for app-sized katas too, like [this guy did]() with tic-tac-toe.

There you are, a list of plenty of online and offline ways to get that exposure.
No more excuses!
Do it to it!
