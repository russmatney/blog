A project I've put off for almost a year,
and it took just a few hours.

I finally moved from the gridlock of templates, 
plugins, 
and once-you-know-the-interface-it's-not-so-bad of Wordpress
to the good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a static weblog.
Jekyll is a ruby gem that builds blogs.
Posts can be written and edited in Markdown,
and there are a handful of optional but convenient features
for just about everything a blog might need.

I also have free hosting courtesy of github pages.

I imported from wordpress and tumblr via directions found here.

running jekyll from the command line is simple as long as you have [ruby prereq]

some nice jekyll features/add ons.

real html! i was able to incorporate this game right into a post!

if you're trying to get up and running yourself, free to reach out, I'm happy to help troubleshoot.
