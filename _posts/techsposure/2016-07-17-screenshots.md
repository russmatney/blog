how to screenshots!

TLDR: OSX/iOS makes basic screen shots super easy.

Cmd + Shift + 3 for a full-screen grab
Cmd + Shift + 4 for a crosshair, then drag and drop a box, OR #protip hit spacebar and click an app window to grab it as-is

Screenshots default to saving to your desktop, but you can customize the destination directory. Mine points to a dropbox folder.

Hard mode: screenshots larger than the window/screen (perhaps a long email you want)?

Also: Cloudapp/up for rapid screenshot sharing
