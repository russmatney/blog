Grunt is designed to do those automated things. 
save yourself some time.

if there's not a grunt-contrib of what you want,
which there very likely is,
you can write your own happy little grunt task
note: grunt-exec for command line joy.
i wrote a grunt command in a phonegap project that compiled and uglyfied coffee-script/angular junk, then moved it down into the right source folder in our ios app. saved me tons of time getting the latest onto the device.

with all the time and brain power grunt will handle for you,
check this out: regex-crossword
i haven't had/needed to get into regex extensively yet
by leaning on the shoulders of my team
but this was a great way to learn the basics without any tl;dr reading of rules
reminds of: vim adventures or shortcut-foo

better grunt files link

maybe get into testing?
