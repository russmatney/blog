Wtf is js

Tl;dr: JS is a programming language with many different uses. It is the predominant language of building interactive websites and web apps because it runs in every browser. It can also be used to build backend apps via a framework called NodeJS. It is dynamically typed and scripted.
All of this makes it a great first language to learn, no matter what you want to do with code.

Origin story

Dynamic types? The shape of data? JSON?

Scripted, not compiled

Websites vs. Interactive websites
