###*TL;DR*:

After building with AngularJS for over a year,
I've developed a few opinions on what belongs in a Controller, Service, Resource, and Directive.
I've also built up a knack for how to deal with common Unit testing problems between some of these pieces.
This post is the first in a series that walks through the Angular architecture that I like.
