###*TL;DR*:

I just refactored some E2E tests from a supertest implementation to one that uses
generators via [`co-supertest`](https://github.com/avbel/co-supertest)
(basically [`supertest`](https://github.com/tj/supertest)
wrapped with [TJ's co lib](https://github.com/tj/co))
for massive readability and therefore maintainability improvements.

##E2E testing is important and very useful, but can get messy

I love using e2e tests to get a project up and running.
Once a few CRUD tests are in place, I'm free to play with whatever
frameworks and architectures I want
without fear of breaking any client-server contracts.

I recently built out a small API with ExpressJS,
and included some E2E protection via `supertest`,
a lib that makes testing HTTP request/response easy.

Basic E2E test with `supertest`:

    it('should return a 200 and data on a get to /users', function(done) {
      request.get('/users')
        .expect(200)
        .expect(function(res) {
          if (!res.body.users) throw new Error('No users array or object on response body');
          if (res.body.users.length !== 0) throw new Error('Array should be empty');
        })
        .end(function(err, res){
          if (err)
            done(err);
          else
            done();
        });
    });

The above example is fine.
But, when you get to a slightly more complex use-case,
the code quickly resembles the Pyramid of Doom.
One example: Authentication e2e tests.

Short of fleshing that example out and for the sake of the length of this post,
here's the co-supertest implementation of the above example. Feast your eyes!

    it('should return a 200 and data on a get to /users', function*() {
      var res = yield request.get('/users')
        .expect(200)
        .end();

      if (!res.body.users)
        throw new Error('No users array or object on response body');
      if (res.body.users.length !== 0)
        throw new Error('Array should be empty');
    });

Much more pleasing to the eye.
The use of `yield` lets us keep our functions a minimal number of layers deep,
and eradicates ugly scoping issues that might crop up.

Testing does not have to be painful! Own your code base!
