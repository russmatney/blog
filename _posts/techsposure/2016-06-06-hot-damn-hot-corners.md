###*TL;DR*:

Hot Corners are a feature of OSX that let you easily move between open windows,
apps, and your desktop.

Hot Corners are clutch in a few specific scenarios:

  - **Desktop Toggle**: A full window app (Chrome, Finder) asks you to drag-drop a file from your computer to the page, and the file is on your desktop
  - **Expos-say/All windows Toggle**: You want quickly move to another app you have open, but can't find the window

##How to Enable

  1. Open **System Preferences**
  2. Click **Mission Control** in the top row
  3. Click **Hot Corners...** on the bottom left

A small menu will drop down, with four select menus, one for each corner.

To find your bearings, a quick test:

- Click the drop-down for the top-right corner
- Select **Desktop** from the drop-down list.
- Now move your mouse into the top right corner of your computer screen

If you found your way back here, congratulations! Now we can behind the backs
of everyone who didn't.

##Toggle that desktop!

The **Desktop** Hot Corner will show your desktop, or take you back to wherever
you just were when you touch it. This is also my favorite Hot Corner usage -
especially when you add in that you can use Hot Corners while you're
clicking-and-dragging files around, which makes it easy to drag files to and
from your desktop in between other apps.

There are a few other Hot Corner options:

- **Application Windows**: will show a nicely spaced view of all windows open
  for your current application
- **Mission Control**: a nice way to show all your running apps, for fast-app
  switching

Both of these are helpful when clicking-and-dragging, as we are want to do.

> *Pro-tip*: You can also switch between Apps with `command` + `Tab`, and
> windows with `command` + `~` (Tilda).
