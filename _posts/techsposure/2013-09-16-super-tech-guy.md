super tech guy! an idea that's bounced around my head for a few weeks now: been thinking about the ways I could be a better programmer, on two levels - ideals i see in the ideal tech guy, and tasks that will take any programmer there.

ugh, star engineer.

Lightning Speeches! - dan public speaking

Guest Blogging! - big blogs are literally asking for it

Pro Tips! - coderwall? etc

Open-Source Contributing! see last post

Tests and Docs! uncle bob

Book reading? meh. online reading? YES! getpocket, email subscriptions, participate in the discussions

Experimenting/Collaborating! github resume, exposure, see open source post

Networking! hate getting recruiter emails and having no one to reference

meetups and active online discussions!

Recruiting! hate needing engineering talent and having no network
