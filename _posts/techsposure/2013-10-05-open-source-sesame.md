*TL;DR*:

Contributing to open-source makes you a better programmer, so just do it.
If you don't know what to do, start a streak and hold yourself to it.
Soon you'll be in the flow.

"Can I tell you something? Your Github profile kind of sucks."

A [friend of mine](https://github.com/rschmukler) said this to me.
I write code often!
I push to github at least 5 days a week!
Was he wrong? No. I only work with private repos.

My public profile sucks.

It's difficult to break into open-source programming.
I think I'm starting to crack the shell now.
After bluntly insulting me, 
Ryan recommended what he called "The Github Challenge."
The goal is to contribute to something open-source every day,
extending the streak shown on your github profile.

[I'm at 12 days now](https://github.com/russmatney), and will hit 13 today.

I have always wanted to push some helpful open-source somethings,
but never known exactly what.
Looking for at least one commit per day has been a good start.
In that last 12 days, I've:

* built my [first grunt plugin](https://github.com/russmatney/grunt-unicorn)
* published [it to npm](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-unicorn)
* updated and republished it when it wasn't working
* pushed up my [nodeschool.io code](https://github.com/russmatney/learnyounode)
* built out and added features to an [AngularJS + Firebase demo](https://github.com/russmatney/firebangular) (live demo [here](/demos/firebangular/#/))
* added my [first gist](https://gist.github.com/russmatney/6748127) (and learned that gists don't count toward the streak)
* pushed an old bit of heavily commented [html+css+javascript+jquery boilerplate](https://github.com/russmatney/jp-concussed)
* and taken the first step toward an [AngularJS CMS demo](https://github.com/russmatney/anguRAWR) that I'm building out of spite

Sure, some of those days I just updated a Readme to better explain it,
or found some other BS commit to keep the streak going.
But I've also seen a spike in productivity and touched a variety of new tech.

Writing and contributing to open-source projects will make you a better programmer.
Working in the open forces you to raise the bar for your own code.
Contributing to larger projects is a great way to raise coding and testing standards.
You'll also get some experience building in a team environment.

Get involved in the direction of projects,
form your own opinions, 
learn some best practices, 
and get exposure to what all this open-sourcey goodness is all about!

Another thing: when I'm looking at new-hires, 
I always look at their github profiles.
I realize now it may have been hypocritical of me...
but hopefully not for long. 
A slim profile doesn't look bad, 
but when hiring, more information always helps confidence in a candidate.

***

Going forward, I have some loose goals.
I'd like to contribute in some different languages (ruby, python, golang, haskell).
I want to build a ruby gem, a jekyll plugin, a jquery plugin, a bower component, a javascript library. 
I use these pieces everyday but know so little about the anatomy of them, 
and building that grunt plugin definitely taught me some grunt and npm background that I should have had a few months ago.

An easy way to get involved and some good reading if you're looking for more:

* [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) sends a daily email with an open issue on whatever open-source project you sign up for
