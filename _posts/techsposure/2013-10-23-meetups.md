meetups!

hackerhours - beginner -> intermediate is not a solo ride. 15 minutes of help can save days, hours, careers, etc.

social aspect
food aspect
networking
etc.
just go!




note: 
helper pages - shortcuts i use (chrome, sublime)
resource pages - learning resources, list/tag languages + difficulty level
