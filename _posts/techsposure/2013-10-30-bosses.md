treehouse getting rid of bosses post(s)

github has flat engineering dept post(s)

the shorter the distance between stackholders the better the product will be

job stories vs user stories?

control issues - autonomy, scalability, growth-sling-shot, too much hand-holding

  - one feature or one bug


master is always deployable


everyone branches/pushes/merges



pull requests are a discussion
code, feature, strategy
