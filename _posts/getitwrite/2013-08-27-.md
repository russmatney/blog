##*TL;DR*:

It's been a while, and
I have an assortment of things that I'm not sure what to do with.
So here they all are pretty much at random.
Some experience with sociology, social media, and society,
some empowering self-control via story selection and controlling our own thoughts, 
and some things I gleaned from reading a few Paul Graham articles a few months ago.

###title of reading

First of all, there was [this awesome reading from *Radiolabs*?]() half a year ago, 
and it definitely deserves a listen.

###universal inner child

[this piece]() from [BrainPickings]() on Ted Hughes deserves a read. 
My notes: Ted writes about how we build a shell to protect us from the real world, 
and when it is pierced, we are scared or angry.
Those emotional times, that is when we grow.
Don't hide inside a shell. 

###how to stay sane

another brain picking called [how to stay sane]().
X X tells us to be careful what stories you expose yourself to:
	
	If we do not have a mind used to hearing good news,
	we do not have the neural pathways to process such news.

That's something to think about in this age of dramatic headlines competing for clicks.

There's a really great bit about optimism too.

###Derailed - Social Currency

A very honest piece about the cost of putting value into emptiness.
("Social currency" referring to our assortment of rewards (retweets, likes, etc.))

###As a Man Thinketh, by James Allen

One of my grandfather's favorite books, with some unique arguments.
The basic premise is that any person controls his or her dentiny and actions, 
at the very root of his thoughts, and through the use of his time.
Grab control of yourself.

(Pending macro-economic influences, of course.)

###Such a worry-wart

I worry, but I also believe worrying doesn't help much of anything. 
It's not easy to let go of, but [this post]() had a great piece of advice:
set aside time for worrying, and do your worrying then. 
Otherwise, forgeddabouttit.

###Some exposure to Paul Graham

Mostly from [this post]()http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html

On "bloggers" as a "fad":

	Actually, the fad is the word "blog," at least the way the print media now use it. What they mean by "blogger" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online. That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for publication. So I'd like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online. How about "writer?"

	Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the average blog. In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against. They're competing against the best writing online.

On old-style business vs the start-up economy:

	Ironically, though open source [projects] and blogs are done for free, those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like communist states.

	The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open source and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of their own are enormously more productive. And a startup is a project of one's own in two senses, both of them important: it's creatively one's own, and also economically ones's own.

	Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects, and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create, give them the actual market value? Impossible? That is in fact what venture capitalists do.

	Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs. But business administration is not what you're doing in a startup. What you're doing is business creation. And the first phase of that is mostly product creation-- that is, hacking. That's the hard part. It's a lot harder to create something people love than to take something people love and figure out how to make money from it.

On working from home vs pretending to work in the office

	The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people work, you can at least prevent them from having fun. If employees have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be working. In theory. In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man's land, where they're neither working nor having fun.

	The other problem with pretend work is that it often looks better than real work. When I'm writing or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do actually typing. Half the time I'm sitting drinking a cup of tea, or walking around the neighborhood. This is a critical phase-- this is where ideas come from-- and yet I'd feel guilty doing this in most offices, with everyone else looking busy.
