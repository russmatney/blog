brain pickings readings and lines:

meaning of life stuff
here to witness the creation and abet it

really like the bit about us going against entropy

good doesn't inherently come out of bad 
that's what creativity is for
it's up to us to find and create something new and better
out of the fragments that entropy leaves us with 

that keeps the universe in balance

derailed - social currency, cost of putting value into emptiness

ted hughes on our universal inner child
we build a shell of an exterior, a second person, armor to protect ourselves
we only really grow when that armor is pierced
let that child out all the time, let it grow

stephen jay gould
not particularly well read, just remembers it, uses 100%
just tying ideas together

how to stay sane
be careful what stories you expose yourself to
`if we do not have a mind used to hearing good news,
we do not have the neural pathways to process such news`
really great bit about optimism too. sow some seeds!

one of my grandfather's favorite books: as a man thinketh by james allen
man controls his dentiny, his actions, all of it, at the very root of his thoughts. grab control of yourself.

alain de botton's new angles on success - making sure it's our own idea, not someone else's.
Ted talk - make sure we're authors of our own ambitions

how to find your purpose and do what you love
prestige is generally not a good idea
best way to get approval is not to need it
creative work vs labor
how to do what you love brain pickings. Paul Graham's prestige words, find something more important than you, making sure success's definition is our own
The best way to get approval is not to need it. Don't give a hoot about the other owls. They're a bunch of grumps anyway.

set aside time for worrying (suicide prevention post)


that awesome bit of reading that adam recommended on radiolabs


read The book of laughter and forgetting by milan kundera and loved it
recommended by this ted talk on balancing the introversion/extroversion favoritism

education startups: kahn academy, nutmeg (getting it right)
