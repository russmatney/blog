##*TL;DR*:

It's been a while;
I have an assortment of things that I'm not sure what to do with.
Here they all are pretty much at random.

###Including You

There was this [awesome reading on Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/story/298146-trouble-everything/)
half a year ago,
and it definitely deserves a listen.
It's by Jenny Hollowell and it starts about
3 and a half minutes in. It's called "A History Of Everything, Including You".

###Universal Inner Child

Check out [this piece](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/09/12/ted-hughes-inner-child-letter/)
from BrainPickings on Ted Hughes and a letter he wrote his son.
It's dense, but worth it.
My notes: Ted writes that we build a secondary self,
as armor to cope with the world, and that our inner child never grows up,
unless we let it.
When that armor is pierced, we are scared, or angry, emotional in some way.
Those times, that is when we grow.

###How to Stay Sane

Another [Brain Picking](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/02/05/how-to-stay-sane-philippa-perry/).
Philippa Perry tells us to be careful what stories we expose ourselves to:

> If we do not have a mind used to hearing good news,
> we do not have the neural pathways to process such news.

That's something to think about, what with all these dramatic headlines competing for clicks.

There's a really great bit about optimism too:

> I am not advocating the kind of optimism that means you blow all your savings on
> a horse running at a hundred to one; I am talking about being optimistic enough
> to sow some seeds in the hope that some of them will germinate and grow into
> flowers.

Sow some seeds!

###Derailed - Social Currency

[A very honest piece](http://rog.ie/blog/derailed) about the cost of putting value into the emptiness of
gamified social websites.

###As a Man Thinketh

[One of my grandfather's favorites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_Man_Thinketh),
with some empowering arguments.
You control your destiny and actions,
at the very root of your thoughts and through the use of your time.

(Pending macro-economic influences, of course.)

###Such a Worry-Wart

I worry, but I also believe worrying doesn't help much of anything.
[This post](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/07/29/kerkhof-worry-technique/) had a great piece of advice:
set aside time for worrying, and do your worrying then.
Maybe 15 minutes in the morning, and 15 more at night if you need it.
Otherwise, forgeddabouttit.

###Some exposure to Paul Graham

Mostly from [this post](http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html) on what
modern business can learn from open-source.

On "bloggers" as a "fad":

> Actually, the fad is the word "blog,"
at least the way the print media now use it.
What they mean by "blogger" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format,
but anyone who publishes online.
That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for publication.
So I'd like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online.
How about "writer?"

...

>	Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online
because of its low average quality are missing an important point:
no one reads the average blog.
In the old world of channels,
it meant something to talk about average quality,
because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not.
But now you can read any writer you want.
So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against.
They're competing against the best writing online.

On old-style business vs the start-up economy:

>	Ironically, though open source [projects] and blogs are done for free,
those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies,
for all their talk about the value of free markets,
are run internally like communist states.

...

>	The big advantage of investment over employment,
as the examples of open source and blogging suggest,
is that people working on projects of their own are enormously more productive.
And a startup is a project of one's own in two senses,
both of them important:
it's creatively one's own,
and also economically one's own.

...

>	Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects,
and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create,
give them the actual market value?
Impossible?
That is in fact what venture capitalists do.

...

>	Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.
But business administration is not what you're doing in a startup.
What you're doing is business creation.
And the first phase of that is mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.
That's the hard part.
It's a lot harder to create something people love
than to take something people love and figure out how to make money from it.

On working from home vs pretending to work in the office:

> The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people work,
you can at least prevent them from having fun.
If employees have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day,
and are forbidden to do non-work things while there,
then they must be working.
In theory.
In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man's land,
where they're neither working nor having fun.

...

> The other problem with pretend work is that it often looks better than real work.
When I'm writing or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do actually typing.
Half the time I'm sitting drinking a cup of tea, or walking around the neighborhood.
This is a critical phase-- this is where ideas come from-- and yet I'd feel guilty doing this in most offices,
with everyone else looking busy.
