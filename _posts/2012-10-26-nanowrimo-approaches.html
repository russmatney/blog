If you've ever wanted to write a novel, now is the time! NaNoWriMo (short for National Novel Writing Month) starts in just a few days. It's a fast paced approach to getting a draft of a novel totally done in 30 days. The goal is to write 50,000 words in one month, no editing, just pure creative chaos. If you're interested, grab paper and a pen and run, hop, skip, or jump (don't walk) to your nearest thinking chair.

You don't have to sign up, but you can <a title="NaNoWriMo" href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">at the website</a> if you want encouraging emails and notifications about local writery meetups.

I wrote a 50k-worder last year, which I finished a few days into December. It's a scrappy, rambling piece of junk, but I learned SO MUCH from it and enjoyed the process immensely. I've grown very rapidly as a writer because of NaNoWriMo and cannot recommend it highly enough, especially if you think you might like writing, or have an idea for a story you think is worth telling.

And besides, writing is fun! Dive in and swim around and go crazy! You can do anything you want! Want to write a story about how a barrel of evil monkeys dominated and enslaved the real-life cast of Toy Story? Want to write that groundbreaking romantic-comedy about the impossible and forbidden long-distance relationship between a woman in Chicago and Santa Clause? Want to write the most epic vampire, werewolf, wizard war story ever? Do whatever you want! You'll be glad you did.

Children, mind ya eyes.) A quote from him sits at the top of my To-Do List:
<blockquote>"We only get one go-around on the Great Hot Wheels Track that is life, so why not manage some slick jumps and loopty-loops before your car flings off into the oblivion beneath the couch?"</blockquote>
And he's totally write.

That's my NaNoWriMo pitch. DO IT.

UNRELATED: I wanted to write a post along the lines of: Things To Never Do In A Blog, but I could only think of one thing, so here it is: Never apologize for the time since your last post, or make excuses about why. Just write whatever you sat down to write. That unnecessary sentence or two ALWAYS annoys me, unless you were abducted by aliens or literally fell off the face of the earth. Actually, in those situations, it still annoys me. Just tell your story.
