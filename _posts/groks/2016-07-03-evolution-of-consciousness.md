###GROK: [*How Did Consciousness Evolve?*](http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/06/how-consciousness-evolved/485558/?single_page=true)

##Goal

I read biology/psychology related stuff to keep up with human behavior
from a science perspective - it is useful for:

- creative fodder for sci-fi
- looking for tech angles on culture and mental health
- finding paradigms to create characters/models for story building

That being said, my goals in those areas are loose - a tighter one for this
piece would be: think about the consciousness of a fictional character - how
developed can it be?

Concept: Evolution as the grand unifying theory of biology

Consciousness's history of understanding has been primarily: philosophy, cognitive science, religion

What is the adaptive value of consciousness? When did it evolve, what animals have it?

####Concept: Attention Schema Theory

  - less than 5 years old
  - states: the brain evolved increasingly sophisticated mechanisms for deeply
    processing a few select signals at the expense of others, and consciouness
    is the ultimate result of that evolution

####Selective Signal Enhancement

  - computing trick: competition
  - nerves shout for attention, only a few are heard
  - SSE: 700-600 million years ago
  - arthropod eye - selects visual edges, supresses the rest
  - primitive - doesn't require a central brain, easily decentralized

####Tectum

  - "roof" in latin
  - central controller for coordinating senses
  - coordinates overt attention
  - all vertebrates have one
  - constructs internal model for predictions and planning of movement and input

####Wulst

  - brain structure, ~350-300 million years ago, reptiles, birds, mammals
  - in humans - became cerebral cortex - is massive, by far largest structure in
    human brain
  - reptiles, probably smarter than we give them credit for

####Cortex

  - upgraded tectum
  - can react variably to variable input (look toward, look away, store in
    memory, etc.)

Tectum is master of overt attention; cortex adds 'covert attention' - moves deep
processing from one item to another

The cortex constructs it's own internal model

  - a very abstract set of info for what covert attention is doing, and what
    it's consequences are (i.e. machine learning)

####Opportunism

  - Teddy Roosevelt: "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are"
  - open minded, optimistic

####Social prediction

  - one's self model beocmes a model used to guess at others

Concept: Theory of Mind

  - ability to understand the contents of another's mind
  - humans, apes, dogs, crows, crocs (care for their young)

####Language

  - a big leap, at least 70k years ago

####Evolutionarily

  - we're hyper tuned to tap into eachother's mind states - that's our adaptive edge
  - Side effects: False postivies: Ghosts
    - [Religion as a healthy, encouraged false-positive for consciousness?]
