Live demo: [Firebangular](/demos/firebangular/#/)

The code: [on Github](https://github.com/russmatney/firebangular).

Firebangular is a basic [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) app that uses [AngularFire](http://angularfire.com/) to hook into Firebase.

[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) is an amazing new piece of tech that gives insanely fast live-data updating across it's clients. 
That plus the data-binding of Angular = developer bliss in little to no time/code.
